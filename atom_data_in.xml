&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;she blinded me with science&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;editor's note: there will be much geek contact in this evening's post, because that's what i've been doing a lot lately. non-geek readers may prefer to wait to hear about the minneapolis/st. paul visit early next week...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are going to be some major changes to this web site soon... i've spent some time the last few days learning &lt;a href="http://www.postnuke.com/"&gt;postnuke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;php/&lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com/"&gt;mysql&lt;/a&gt;-based content management system of &lt;a href="http://phpnuke.org/"&gt;php-nuke&lt;/a&gt; progeny. it's got plenty of features i don't need, but lots that i want and need. (for example, i'm quite impressed with the &lt;a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=index"&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt; web-based photo album, which acts as a postnuke module/block. since i've got this digital camera i have all these pictures from africa, events with friends, etc. that need to get posted for others to see.) so i'm almost ready to roll it up to the real webserver, although i'll have to use someone else's free theme graphics until i have time to create my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i also geeked out some more this morning in upgrading to the latest version of &lt;a href="http://www.snort.org/"&gt;snort&lt;/a&gt; on the win32 laptop (see &lt;a href="http://www.silicondefense.com/techsupport/windows.htm"&gt;installation tips from silicon defense&lt;/a&gt;). i also started using &lt;a href="http://www.packx.net/"&gt;pack-x&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://www.packx.net/packx/html/en/index-en.htm"&gt;ids center&lt;/a&gt;, which i don't think i've looked at for a while but am now quite impressed. highly recommended if you're using "the pig" on win32 (the other pig).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i should be off to bed now, as ains &amp;amp; i are flying to the twin cities tomorrow. keith is kindly driving us to beantown around 7:45am, and all 3 of us in the house will be vying for the bathroom before then. (that may be one advantage of having my &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; apartment, hopefully soon).&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/83441426'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/83441426'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#83441426' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-83310434</id><published>2002-10-21T21:12:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2008-06-12T06:42:35.516+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;back in the u.s.s.r.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as the beatles sang, "you don't know how lucky you are, boy!" well, admittedly, i'm not back in the area-formerly-known-as-the-soviet-union, but back is the u-s-of-a. and, moreso, i've been back for a while now... since the beginning of september, actually. furthermore, i don't believe in luck, but i do believe in a God who loves me very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apologies to you adoring fans (both of you) and to my future self, as this blog is probably as much for me to remember the past as it is for a few now distant friends who like to keep up on my whereabouts. since i haven't been working since i returned, i can't really say i have an excuse, other than the fact that i've been semi-homeless and hopping from house to house, some with 'net connectivity and some without. but really, i just didn't know what to say...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm still mentally processing the trip to africa, and when people ask about it i just don't know what to say. the usual response is, "yeah, it was amazing... God really met us there and worked wonders in us and around us." that's the short of it, at least. we really enjoyed the time and the tasks, in particular meeting the people and gaining some family out there; and we want so much to return each summer if the Lord wills. and truly if anything worthwhile was accomplished while we were there, god did the work and not us, because it was fully evident that we had nothing of value to offer but our willingness to let the Spirit work through us. and ainsley and i returned as two different people than when we left, having been transformed by a renewed faith in Jesus' power and love. i guess you could say we're "Jesus freaks" now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the days since returning have been interesting. since i moved all my stuff into storage and moved out of my apartment at the end of july, i've been trying not to wear out my welcome with the marvelous group of friends who've been putting me up (or rather, putting up with me) for so long: troy &amp;amp; maegan, dave (&amp;amp; kim), and lance and keith. although living out of a suitcase for so long is frustrating, it's been a lot of fun to build relationships with these friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you may also remember what i used to call my "rare tropical disease"... no surprise that it's not a tropical disease (because i had it before i ever went to the tropics), and if it's what we think it is, it's not too rare either. many of the symptoms both from this year and previous incidents of digestive troubles point to crohn's disease. (to find out more, check out &lt;a href="http://www.healingwell.com/library/ibd/info1.asp"&gt;this introduction&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.ccfa.org/"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; for tons of info). hopefully, the gastoenterologist should be getting the results from last weeks' "ugi with small bowel follow-through" x-rays soon, then we'll be able to figure out what's going on or what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as for the unemployment: i was just starting to get a bit worried, and now there's a couple opportunities coming down the pike. i may go to maryland for 3 weeks or so for a short contract doing lotus notes development and assisting with firewall deployment. and the guys at my old consulting firm &lt;a href="http://www.tcml.com/"&gt;the computer merchant&lt;/a&gt; think that the market for contract work will be picking up in december and january, so that would be great. and, in the category of fun distractions, i might even help out moving hay bales at a standish farm over the next couple weeks: some good healthy physical labor would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ains &amp;amp; i have done and will be doing more than a bit of travelling. last weekend we drove out to mentor, ohio, for a family gathering in which i got scrutinized by ainsley's cousins and her aunt's friends (i think i passed). this coming weekend we're flying to the twin cities to check out &lt;a href="http://www.bethel.edu/seminary/bsphome.htm"&gt;bethel seminary&lt;/a&gt; and area churches and businesses. then we should be with her parents for turkey day and a wedding. (and maybe ainsley's family will come out to join my family in camden for christmas&amp;#8212;how cool is that?!?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;note-to-self&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;to-do list for the upcoming days:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get background checks and drug tests for the maryland job
&lt;li&gt;write thank-you letters to all the folks who supported me for the africa trip
&lt;li&gt;get a new credit card so i can take advantage of a balance transfer to tide me over until the job money starts coming in
&lt;li&gt;look for an apartment
&lt;li&gt;update my website with &lt;a href="http://www.postnuke.com/"&gt;postnuke&lt;/a&gt; (really! this time i mean it!)
&lt;/ul&gt;
that's not even the half of it, really, but it's a start anyway...&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/note-to-self&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i think that's more than enough blabbering for today. perhaps in the coming days i can share more amusing stories of the latest adventures or even journal entries from the time in rwanda. (or maybe i'll get too busy working on other stuff.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; grassroots music distribution's &lt;a href="http://www.grassrootsmusic.com/artist/grassroots/dialects1?fromquery=dialects"&gt;dialects, vol. 1: folk/americana&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; over the past few months i've found some great christian music recommendations at &lt;a href="http://www.grassrootsmusic.com/"&gt;grassroots&lt;/a&gt;, so i picked up this sampler of folkish folks. i like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;airbag&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;22 hours until we leave portland. everything's falling together&amp;#8212;of course i knew god could make it all happen, but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't worrying about all the details these past two weeks. i'm so excited; this is going to be so marvelous. don't forget to pray for us&lt;a href="http://www.cav2000.org/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today has been a fine, productive day. it started at 5am (ouch) so i could have some time to pack before going to the men's breakfast at my church (combined with the man club) at 7. the fellowship was quite encouraging, and the good high-protein breakfast was well fit for the work ahead. then a handful of guys helped me out with the rest of the packing and all of the moving to storage: alan (my boss, isn't he great?), tom (from my church and the men's ministry committee), keith (who helped me a ton on monday, too), ken (who didn't think he would be in town), and troy (who stayed home this weekend specifically to help me out!). we finished it up a couple of hours ago, and now the house is nearly empty, excepting my luggage, cleaning materials, empty boxes, and myself... wow. i'm so grateful that these guys could help me out, and i'm feeling supported and encouraged now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw, keep praying for my friends nathan and karen&amp;#8212;this coming wednesday they are going to take their nine-month old daughter anna to the children's hospital in boston for brain surgery. there'll be a week of observation with wires actually going into her skull and monitoring different parts of her brain to determine the extent of the defect, and then next wednesday they intend to operate and remove whatever is necessary, up to her entire left hemisphere. obviously, this is frightening for both parents and child, as well as friends and family. but they have a strong faith in the lord's goodness and his wisdom in choosing what he will, and i know that will sustain them and glorify our lord their hope. if the lord wills, perhaps in a couple weeks anna will be seizure-free and developing normally, and we would praise him for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have no idea if this will be the last post for a while now or not, as i don't know how often and how much i might have internet access from kigali. but i'll try, i really will, as i know a few of you are eager to hear the news in realtime. either way, you'll definitely hear from me in september (unless of course you never visit this page again, in which case i don't blame you)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://www.petermulvey.com"&gt;peter mulvey&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://www.signature-sounds.com/artistpage/artistpage.php3?artist=petermulvey"&gt;ten thousand mornings&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; i'm so glad this arrived so i could hear it before i leave the country and the cd collection behind... it's another live album (recorded in the &lt;a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedmaps/subway/index.cfm"&gt;subways of boston&lt;/a&gt;), and he is so good live. he also covers so great songs from other artists such as gillian welch, dar williams, etc. and when he covers someone else's song he really makes it his own. highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;waterfall&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;3 days until we leave for africa... i have my tickets right here. the empty and full boxes are piling up in my apartment, and the storage shed now has its first few contents. it seems that i've scheduled every remaining hour of the next few days (and that doesn't include sleep!).&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my boss let me take a couple technical certification tests just before i leave the company as a "resume builder" of sorts&amp;#8212;these were tests where i already knew the content pretty darn well from several years of real-world experience, but it might help to have the certificate to back it up. last week i took and passed team database's new &lt;a href="http://www.teamdatabase.com/Certifications/IndustryExam.db"&gt;database industry exam&lt;/a&gt;, and today i passed the &lt;a href="http://www.ciwcertified.com/exams/1d0410.asp?comm=home&amp;llm=4"&gt;ciw foundations exam&lt;/a&gt;. that means i can now add &lt;a href="http://www.teamdatabase.com/Certifications/DatabaseIndustrySpecialist.db"&gt;certified database industry specialist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ciwcertified.com/certifications/foundationsv4.asp?comm=home&amp;llm=3"&gt;ciw associate&lt;/a&gt; to my titles. (and btw i quickly reviewed the altogether lousy &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764516353/ewallorg"&gt;ciw foundations for dummies&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_70448811652"&gt;epinions&lt;/a&gt;, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at noon today we had the first (and last) pre-trip preparation meeting, and it went really well. tim wah-luc kept us on task and organized while we discussed the specifics of our goals and roles while we are there. when mutima greeted me as the "chief of staff", i knew i should be worrying a bit, and sure enough it was a hint that i had been selected as the team leader for the four of us who are leaving on monday, and reporting directly to sebastien while we're in-country. although it's humbling, i'm excited for the challenge, and glad that god has prepared me with helpful experiences in the past (for example, since we'll be working out a lot of the details of how to run the reconciliation conferences smoothly and train others to keep up the work, i'm thrilled to have the &lt;a href="http://www.tayloru.edu/upland/studentlife/two/yc/"&gt;youth conference&lt;/a&gt; co-director experience in my background.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i should get back to work, as i have miles to go before i sleep...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; victoria williams and the loose band &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=322601"&gt;this moment&amp;#8212;live in toronto&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; victoria is the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060953020/qid=1027025206/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-4804243-6627058/ewallorg"&gt;annie dillard&lt;/a&gt; of the music world, and this is a great live set. she is charming and funny and real, and the whole band works together for a free-wheelin' fun sound.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/79120528'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/79120528'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#79120528' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-78922954</id><published>2002-07-14T06:35:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2008-06-12T06:42:35.555+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;congratulations&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm so worn out... spent the day in the sun and water for the "nsme infrastructure summer gathering 2002", which was conveniently scheduled so that ains &amp;amp; i could go before we left. totally enjoyed chatting with everyone, playing with and laughing at all the kids, and going crazy on rich's &lt;a href="http://www.yamaha-motor.com/products/models.asp?lid=3&amp;lc=wvr&amp;cid=9"&gt;waverunners&lt;/a&gt;. (i was almost at 50mph on that thing&amp;#8212;sheesh, i didn't even know they could go that fast!) pictures are ensuing (this was the first day i could use my new digital camera), but i'm too lazy right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as a "parting gift" they gave me a &lt;a href="http://www.leatherman.com/products/tools/wave/default.asp"&gt;leatherman wave&lt;/a&gt; engraved with my name and "nsc infrastructure / july 2002". (i'll admit it's not as cool as my &lt;a href="http://www.gerberblades.com/gerberlegendaryblades.html?8251"&gt;gerber urban legend&lt;/a&gt;, but it will be just as handy.) they got the idea because rich got a similar one for his 5-year-employee gift at &lt;a href="http://www.national.com/"&gt;national&lt;/a&gt;, and since i was a contractor for more than half of my 5 years there, it seemed to fit. and, incidentally, i dropped the dang thing on my big toe a few minutes ago, and it's still hurting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i should get to bed, as i haven't been getting nearly enough sleep this week. and to help me to sleep i have the first "for dummies" book i've read (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764516353/ewallorg"&gt;ciw foundations for dummies&lt;/a&gt;, most recommended for studying/reviewing for the &lt;a href="http://www.ciwcertified.com/exams/1d0410.asp?comm=home&amp;llm=4"&gt;exam&lt;/a&gt; i'll be taking next week). believe it or not, i find this "dummies-books" series more boring than a real, meaty computer book from &lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/"&gt;o'reilly press&lt;/a&gt;, for example... this book is so redundant and repetative and reduplicative (you can say that again!) and not in the least bit funny. oh well, it'll get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; juliana hatfield's &lt;a href="http://www.julianasite.com/light/disc/oe.html"&gt;only everything&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; only $2.99 (used) at &lt;a href="http://shop.store.yahoo.com/newburycomics/index.html"&gt;newbury comics&lt;/a&gt; the other day... couldn't pass that up! juliana's a fine songwriter and pretty darn good on the guitar, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;you have redeemed my soul&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this just in from the ever-present &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/"&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the red swingline stapler (from the inspiring movie &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0151804"&gt;office space&lt;/a&gt;) is available for purchase! i hope someone gets me one as a going-away present... ;^)
&lt;li&gt;the excellent ray-tracing software &lt;a href="http://www.povray.org/"&gt;pov-ray v3.5&lt;/a&gt; has been released.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;mutimha got our plane tickets yesterday, so the official dates are july 22nd thru august 31st. that's two days earlier than i was expecting&amp;#8212;yowsers! but god has been sooo good... the tickets were like half the price we were expecting, so the fund-raising dollars will go a long way not only to get us there but also to fill the critical operating budget fund (out of which the salaries for mutimha, sebastien and the loan officers are paid, when there's enough money). and my landlord just called to say that he found someone to take my apartment as soon as i'm gone, so i won't have to pay a month of pointless rent. hopefully the &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SYZYGUS/"&gt;syzygus&lt;/a&gt; folks will be able to help me move everything to storage next saturday, and i can clean the apartment on sunday, and around 5am monday we'll be off to boston. amazing, really!&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i developed a really old roll of film the other day (the pictures spanned a year and a half!) and there were some fun ones in there, including a wonderful picture of ains &amp;amp; me. also, on a boring winter evening a while back i had taken a couple shots for &lt;a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/"&gt;the mirror project&lt;/a&gt;, and they were accepted &lt;a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/search/results/?id=7679&amp;term=Eric+Wallace&amp;x=9&amp;y=7"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/search/results/?term=Eric+Wallace&amp;x=9&amp;y=7"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (the latter one is much cooler, don't you think?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i've got a huge list of phone calls to make, and ten minutes until my next appointment, so here goes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;you are so good to me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;8 work days left (i need to use 2 "floater" holidays in the next 2 weeks&amp;#8212;those will come in handy!), and roughly 18 days until we lift off. last night ains &amp;amp; i had a good talk about my fears and unwillingness to get all the stuff done that needs to be done before i go, and now i'm pretty motivated to get going on it all. and that's part of what i'm doing today...&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;geek stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;of course, i had to do just a little bit more geeky stuff before i go, so i'm finally following through on my goal of installing linux on my laptop. i gave up on &lt;a href="http://www.debian.org/"&gt;debian&lt;/a&gt; due to their perhaps "retension" and reluctance to get moving... i mean, i appreciate and desire stability in the os, but i also need a current version of &lt;a href="http://www.xfree86.org/"&gt;xfree86&lt;/a&gt; and want &lt;a href="http://www.kde.org/"&gt;kde&lt;/a&gt; 3.x, and i don't want to sacrifice other stability by running &lt;a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/unstable/"&gt;sid&lt;/a&gt;. so i gave up waiting for woody (i.e. the "testing" release to be named "stable"), and decided to try &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/"&gt;gentoo&lt;/a&gt;. i'm so glad i did! i discovered them when i realized that i know a couple of the &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/index-devlist.html"&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.css.tayloru.edu/"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt;, so i figured i'd see why they'd attach themselves to this lesser-known but up-and-coming distro. it's primary distinguishing feature is a bsd-like ports-based method for software distribution (called &lt;a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/portage-manual.html"&gt;portage&lt;/a&gt;), which is an advantage both in ease of use and in performance and efficiency (and anyone who knows me will agree that &lt;i&gt;i'm all about efficiency&lt;/i&gt;). so far the installation has gone sooo smoothly, and the system is compiling the core stuff right now as i type, and i'm sooo impressed. stay tuned for more raving about gentoo!&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/geek stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's been so hot and humid here lately, and now it's just started raining beautiful, big, heavy drops. oh, let it pour! i guess it's winter in the southern hemisphere now and there's a bit of draught in central africa, so it shouldn't be too bad in kigali (our "home base" during our stay). &lt;a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/local/RWXX0001"&gt;this weather.com page&lt;/a&gt; sometimes has the stats&amp;#8212;temps in the 70's and 80's with low humidity doesn't look bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;sledgehammer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;strike that from this morning's entry: i have now talked with my landlord, finally. and i'll be darned if he didn't say, &lt;i&gt;"well, if you had notified me sooner it would be easier to find someone to take the apartment for august..."&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8212;that's why i've been calling him every other day for three weeks now! at least he admitted it was partially his fault, and is going to try to get a tenant by august to save me wasting that month's rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i got a haircut after work tonight, super-short so it will maybe last through the end of the africa trip. since my regular stylist is out on maternity leave, it's always a crap-shoot when i go, and i cross my fingers hoping that "bonnie" won't be cutting my hair. but hey&amp;#8212;she wasn't even there tonight, so it worked out just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i broke down and ordered the digital camera i've been eyeing for months (the &lt;a href="http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/s200/index.html"&gt;canon powershot s200&lt;/a&gt;), in time for the africa trip. my boss owns its predecessor, the s100, and is obsessed with it, and rightfully so, as it's a darn good camera, and most of the reviews agree that canon is winning the consumer-grade digital camera wars by a long shot (no pun intended). buy.com&lt;a href="http://www.buy.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had the best prices and dependability, although &lt;a href="http://www.nextag.com"&gt;nextag&lt;/a&gt; listed some better deals from unreputable companies. i'm so excited&amp;#8212;new toys!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i should go to bed... tomorrow will be a long day of celebrating our nation's independance while keeping an eye on the skies, if george w. bush's "intelligence" sources are to be believed!

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;dragging hooks&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;12 work days (after today); approximately 3 weeks until we're africa-bound. i still haven't been able to speak with my landlord about vacating the apartment before i leave, and i still haven't packed a single box (although i've sold or donated off some junk). i'm finding it hard to believe.&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/countdown&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i had the most delightful weekend, starting with friday night's first session of couple counselling with ainsley, where we began the discussion and learning of more "tools" for aiding communication, etc. in our relationship. then saturday i had most of the morning and afternoon to myself, including 14 miles on the bike and an hour in the sun; then in the evening ains &amp;amp; i went to a "pre-wedding celebration dinner" at the somewhat-hoaky &lt;a href="http://www.dimillos.com/restaurant/index.html"&gt;dimillo's floating restaurant&lt;/a&gt;. the little jewish wedding, complete with huppa and souvenir yarmulkes, was just beautiful, and the following contradancing and visiting with ainsley's friends from chicago's contradancing scene was so much fun. afterwards we even made it to syzygus at sara's house for a little bit of jamming-to-the-oldies (a.k.a. "hymns") on the guitar, banjo and mandolin. with a weekend like that, i'm sure you'll have no trouble imagining the difficulty i had getting up for work monday morning...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then monday morning didn't turn out too bad after all, as my parents were leaving for their vacation and stopped by to drop off what mom had prepared for sending out my "support letter" for the africa trip... it was so cool, not only had mom prepared the envelopes with all the addresses of friends and relatives she thought would be good to send to, but she had written an article for her church's newsletter about how she feels about me going to africa, and she included it in the envelopes. the conclusion of her article was, essentially, "there's no place safer than in the center of god's will." right on, mom&amp;#8212;and thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a co-worker from corporate's infosec group is now including this footer in all his emails. i find it more than a bit amusing, even as i'm the security-freak and infosec whistle-blower at my site. (if you get bored reading it, skip to the last sentence for the best laugh.):
&lt;blockquote&gt;never launch attachments inside email, even email from me. always detach and scan the file for virus infection first. never open attachments from people you do not know. check with the sender before saving attachments you did not expect, even from people you know. if this message is digitally signed, any attachment should be safe to detach. when in doubt about security or possible security problems, call me or anyone else in information security for guidance. call xxx-xxxx to report any security incident that is currently in progress. a "false" alarm is better than no alarm at all. these warnings must be attached to every copy of this document. remember that cassandra was right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i decided to use &lt;a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/ewall/diary"&gt;my k5 diary&lt;/a&gt; as a scratch board for the day's poetic-type musings. i don't know if this is a good idea, so read today's entry and answer the poll question, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;e-bow the letter&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ainsley &amp;amp; i had a marvelous weekend up at my parents', and in particular enjoyed speaking about our upcoming africa trip at the evening service at &lt;a href="http://www.midcoast.com/~chestnut/"&gt;dad's church&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mungu asifiwe&lt;/i&gt;, ainsley has over two-thirds of her support already! on the other hand, i've done very little asking for money, so i have very little raised with one month to go (we'll probably leave a month from yesterday, in fact). but i trust that god will work it out, even with the job problems and all that&amp;#8212;i believe this is important to him as well, not just to us. anyway, tonight i must write some sort of support letter to send to a few people (if you're reading this and you want a copy, email me (see the "sendmail" link at the left).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="noindent"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;geek-stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i finally broke the 30,000 barrier in &lt;a href="http://www.distributed.net/"&gt;distributed.net&lt;/a&gt;'s top users overall! oh oh, how should I celebrate? if you're really bored, take a look at &lt;a href="http://stats.distributed.net/participant/psummary.php?project_id=5&amp;id=353405"&gt;my stats page&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i was just updating my &lt;a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/"&gt;html-kit&lt;/a&gt; app, which is a windoze web page editor (not just html but php, cf, etc.) that's free for personal use, and it's targetted for the knowledgeable user (read: real code, not gu-ey). i've had it on my work computer for a while, but haven't really taken advantage of it&amp;#8212;but there is plenty to take advantage of. recommended for all you web-codeheads.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the other day i joined a new group called &lt;a href="http://www.teamdatabase.com"&gt;team database&lt;/a&gt;, partially inspired by their new &lt;a href="http://www.teamdatabase.com/Certifications/IndustryExam.db"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;db industry cert test and partly aided by the &lt;a href="http://www.teamdatabase.com/Membership.db"&gt;charter member price&lt;/a&gt;. they sound like they've got their heads screwed on right, so i hope they stick around a while.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/geek-stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ains &amp;amp; i might take mutima's kids to see &lt;a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/liloandstitch/index2.html"&gt;lilo &amp;amp; stitch&lt;/a&gt; tonight, maybe even at the &lt;a href="http://www.driveinmovie.com/ME.htm"&gt;drive-in&lt;/a&gt;. i'd seen the reviews a while back and thought it'd be fun, but now i've heard that the soundtrack is all &lt;a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/elvis/elvishom.html"&gt;elvis&lt;/a&gt; songs, and i'm piped! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;ricochet in time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there are plenty of things i should be doing right now, including writing a support letter for my africa trip, updating my resume, paying bills, doing laundry and packing for the weekend at my parents' house, getting ready for bed so i actually get enough sleep today and maybe could get up early enough for a bike ride in the morning, and so on... but no, i'm doing really useful things like cleaning out the pile of mail on the kitchen table and sorting through my &lt;a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/"&gt;yahoo! mail&lt;/a&gt; account... at least i'm being somewhat productive! i had a good session with my counsellor this morning on dealing with my tendency towards &lt;a href="http://webster.directhit.com/webster/search.aspx?qry=procrastinate"&gt;procrastination&lt;/a&gt;... so i wonder if i'm merely trying to fool myself now? sometimes i confuse me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uh-oh... the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/series/-/719/dvd/ref%3Dpd%5Fdp%5Fseries/104-1031056-4355925/ewallorg"&gt;lexx series 3 dvd's&lt;/a&gt; are out now. i didn't discover &lt;a href="http://www.scifi.com/"&gt;the sci-fi channel&lt;/a&gt;'s show &lt;a href="http://lexx.com/"&gt;lexx&lt;/a&gt; until the third season anyway, but quickly became addicted... and then i moved out of the apartment and haven't even considered getting cable again. the show's earlier seasons just didn't have the same bite, so i haven't been much interested in them... but the catchy storyline and the excellent cinematography of season 3 and beyond was worthwhile (and you don't catch me recommending tv shows that often, do you?). oh, and &lt;a href="http://lexx.com/board/viewthread.php3?FID=1&amp;TID=860"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;rumor has it that series 4 also wasn't that hot. oh well... maybe someday i'll cough up the cash for the dvd's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from the i-emailed-myself-this-link-months-ago-with-the-intention-of-linking-it-in-my-blog department, here's &lt;a href="http://www.they.com/disclaimer/"&gt;every disclaimer in the book&lt;/a&gt;. could be handy to throw some of these in future employment contracts, i think... especially the bit about the mysterious "gluing force" which holds everything together but can't necessarily be depended on... yeah, that's the ticket. but on second thought: no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; shawn colvin's &lt;a href="http://store.artistdirect.com/store/artist/album/0,,219228,00.html"&gt;live 88&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; good luck finding this album, even &lt;a href="http://cdnow.com"&gt;cdnow&lt;/a&gt; doesn't have it. recorded before her first album &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=318022"&gt;steady on&lt;/a&gt;, this is a simple live concert with just her voice and her guitar, and it's great just the way it is. apparently in 1995 a company called &lt;a href="http://www.plump.com/colvin.htm"&gt;plump records&lt;/a&gt; re-released this recording which she used to self-market on cassette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;dreaming while you sleep&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tonight i'm thanking god for the anti-lock brakes on my &lt;a href="http://www.obsportal.com/"&gt;outback sport&lt;/a&gt; (affectionately referred to as &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316769495/ewallorg"&gt;zooey&lt;/a&gt;)... just a few minutes ago, on the way home from &lt;a href="http://www.foodinportland.com/benkay.html"&gt;benkay sushi&lt;/a&gt; (a monthly traditional follow-up to &lt;a href="http://www.galileebc.org/"&gt;galilee&lt;/a&gt; youth mayhem at the robie gym), a guy just ran out in front of my car. the sheer stupidity of his running across a busy street with no regard for his personal safety, combined with the difficulty of seeing him amidst the rain and oncoming traffic, meant that i didn't see him until he was silhouetted by another's headlights as he was directly in front of my car... i missed him by inches, not feet, and he didn't even stop or look back or even seem to notice i had just come to a screeching halt, but just ran off into an alleyway. the lady in the car parked on the side of the road seemed to be laughing at me as i sat there dumbfounded for a moment, as if to say, "he does that all the time." yikes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ainsley's in new york city this weekend to go to the &lt;a href="http://www.brooklyntabernacle.org/"&gt;brooklyn tabernacle&lt;/a&gt; with barbara, who thinks the world of this church and has wanted to take ains there for years, so i'm sure they'll have a good time. so, although i'm missing her a little bit, i'm celebrating her weekend away with a pint of &lt;a href="http://www.benjerry.com/"&gt;ben &amp;amp; jerry's&lt;/a&gt; "new york super fudge chunk". (hey, no one said i had to stay at home and pout while she's away!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i do need to keep on a positive note this weekend, because friday just as i was leaving work my boss called me into his office to chat for a minute, and it wasn't good news. he had received the final, official response from his boss, who had spoken with hr about my proposed leave-of-absence for six weeks in africa, and they decided that it wasn't worth trying to keep me on as an employee when i return. (and this is after i had told them i'd be staying in town and working through the fall until the end of the calendar year.) so, five years at this company and my boss and our group say they don't know how they'll live without me, and the department head still thinks i'm a useless, replaceable warm body. as you can tell, i'm rather hurt by this, and i need to keep my attitude in check so that i don't complain or retaliate or slough off the remaining five weeks of work&amp;#8212;i must continue to be a good witness to them all throughout this time as well (i'm clinging to &lt;a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1TIM+4:16&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on"&gt;1 timothy 4:16&lt;/a&gt;). at the same time, i'm going to be going crazy trying to get ready for africa, move out of my apartment, apply for &lt;a href="http://www.bethel.edu/seminary/bsphome.htm"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt;, and find jobs either here or in &lt;a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/"&gt;the twin cities&lt;/a&gt;. so if any of you have connections that can get me a short-term system integrator position here in maine or a long-term consulting gig in minnesota, let me know (email link is on the left side)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, i need to get ready for bed, and then a little more reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0618002227/ewallorg"&gt;the fellowship of the ring&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; getting good now that i've trudged through more than half of it (please, no flames&amp;#8212;i just can't tollerate long descriptive histories and insignificant details, which is seemingly all tolkien writes). goodnight all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sinead o'connor's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=456792"&gt;so far... (best of)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; people joke about this being her "greatest hit" (not the use of the singular) record, but i'm finding it quite interesting. i was intriqued by &lt;a href="http://www.petermulvey.com/"&gt;peter mulvey&lt;/a&gt;'s cover of her song "i am stretching on your grave", and so i picked up this disc, and i'm glad i did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;beat the time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;today, i bring you only linkage. but it's funny linkage, so don't pass it up. ~ed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;recently i was doing some "serious" reading on the web, specifically in the medical field as it relates to my travels and hobbies, when i came upon &lt;a href="http://climb.mountainzone.com/everest/2002/html/dispatch_0505_brown.html"&gt;this article on high altitude medicine&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. for mountain climbers). the descriptions of various conditions, treatments, etc. was all quite interesting, but i found the final ailment to cause a few snickers (i am a guy, after all): yes, &lt;a href="http://www.adam.com/b2b/products/demos/odh/hafe.html"&gt;high altitude flatus expulsion&lt;/a&gt; does exist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i used to check up on mcsweeney's internet tendency every day, but i grew out of it. still, every once in a while i go back and look through the lists, so the other night i found these 
knee-slappers (highly recommended):&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/lists/obsessive.html"&gt;obsessive behaviors exhibited towards your emotions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/lists/morningshows.html"&gt;cancelled regional morning tv shows&lt;/a&gt; (warning: some offensive language)
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/lists/dives.html"&gt;dives not recognized by the olympic diving committe&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;close my eyes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first, the updates: tuesday morning ains &amp;amp; i returned from 5 days out in &lt;a href="http://www.columbus.org/"&gt;columbus&lt;/a&gt; for the wedding of one of her dear friends from lift. it was my first time meeting them, and&amp;#8212;phew!&amp;#8212;i passed the test... and had a wonderful time visiting with them. we also got to spend a morning with ainsley's aunt alice (who happens to be a member of the &lt;a href="http://www.cityclub.org/"&gt;city club of cleveland&lt;/a&gt;, whose thought-provoking speeches are sometimes broadcast on &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/"&gt;npr&lt;/a&gt;) and with my college roomie tyler and his wife elizabeth. and we put about 800 miles on the rental car (tip: go with &lt;a href="http://www.budget.com"&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dir.travelzoo.com/Car.asp?intCategory=31"&gt;travelzoo deals&lt;/a&gt;) and 2200 miles on the &lt;a href="http://www.nwa.com/freqfly/"&gt;frequent flyer&lt;/a&gt; program (which will come in handy if we move to the twin cities near one of &lt;a href="http://www.nwa.com/travel/trave/airports/MSP.shtml"&gt;northwest's hub airports&lt;/a&gt;). anyway, all in all it was just a delightful trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now i'm back at work. yippee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but now i can play the linking game, because i've been saving up links at work and at home, and now i'm passing along the savings to you! here's a couple articles from &lt;a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/"&gt;k5&lt;/a&gt; that were interesting (&lt;i&gt;note to self: must finish reading these&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/5/28/143039/908"&gt;adventures in home brewing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/6/5/131532/0824"&gt;slavery in the 21st century&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there's more to come (eventually)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the cowboy junkies' &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1367958"&gt;open&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; my fav band &lt;a href="http://overtherhine.com/"&gt;over the rhine&lt;/a&gt; toured with the junkies back before their &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1344174"&gt;films for radio&lt;/a&gt; tour, and i believe it had some good effect on the timmins family band. of course, having sweet-voiced &lt;a href="http://overtherhine.com/people/musicians/karin.html"&gt;karin&lt;/a&gt; on bgv's and sassy-fingers &lt;a href="http://overtherhine.com/people/musicians/linford.html"&gt;linford&lt;/a&gt; on keys didn't hurt, either. so (imho) this recording is easily ten times better than &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=509531"&gt;their previous&lt;/a&gt;, so slow and groovy and chilled... i don't know why i waited so long to get this one, but i'm so glad i have it now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/77472822'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/77472822'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#77472822' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-77066459</id><published>2002-05-28T18:58:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2008-06-12T06:42:35.762+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;headphones&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sheesh... for some reason i'm overcome with the urge to buy new gadgets and toys lately. perhaps i should keep in mind the &lt;a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NIV&amp;passage=Ex+20%3A17"&gt;tenth commandment&lt;/a&gt; (not to be confused with the &lt;a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment10/"&gt;tenth amendment&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it all started when i saw that &lt;a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/"&gt;musician's friend&lt;/a&gt; had a scratch-and-dent &lt;a href="http://www.crateamps.com/products/ca/ca30d.htm"&gt;crate ca-30d acoustic combo amp&lt;/a&gt;... with the built-in digital effects, i wouldn't consider buying any &lt;a href="http://www.digitech.com/"&gt;additional effects pedals&lt;/a&gt; for a while...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've been wanting a pda upgrade, but waiting for handspring to make a thin, rechargeable, color palm-os handheld... well, the exact thing is still not available, but they do have the newly announced &lt;a href="http://www.handspring.com/products/treo90/index.jhtml?sub_nav_section=Overview&amp;prod_cat_name=Treo90"&gt;treo 90&lt;/a&gt;, super small and light but with a built-in keyboard and protective flip-top. but they dropped the springboard slot for the smaller, more common secure digital (sd/mmc) cards. now i'm so confused... i'd really like to stick with the very useable palm-os interface (and my investment in &lt;a href="http://www.palmgear.com"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt;), but the advantages of the linux-based &lt;a href="http://www.sharp-usa.com/products/TypeLanding/0,1056,112,00.html"&gt;sharp zaurus sl-5500&lt;/a&gt; are calling me, especially the idea of an &lt;a href="http://www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=194&amp;grid=22"&gt;802.11b wireless card for the compactflash slot&lt;/a&gt;. (btw, the sl-5500 is currently &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000063D6E/ewallorg"&gt;on sale at amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.bargainpda.com"&gt;bargainpda&lt;/a&gt; is where i found out about the deal.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maybe as a trial i should install &lt;a href="http://www.pocketlinux.org/"&gt;pocketlinux&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia/"&gt;qtopia&lt;/a&gt; on my work &lt;a href="http://www.compaq.com/products/handhelds/pocketpc/H3850.html"&gt;ipaq&lt;/a&gt;, and see how i like it. perhaps i could even borrow a &lt;a href="http://www.compaq.com/products/wireless/wlan/wl110.html"&gt;compaq wireless card&lt;/a&gt; and try out &lt;a href="http://www.atstake.com/research/tools/index.html#network_utilities"&gt;netcat&lt;/a&gt; and such. i wonder if &lt;a href="http://airsnort.shmoo.com/"&gt;airsnort&lt;/a&gt; would work on such a unit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and of course, i'm still interested in getting a digital camera, but i should make the decision on which type of memory card is preferred first. and my boss just got his &lt;a href="http://www.frontierlabs.com/NexII.html"&gt;nex 2 mp3 player&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not that i have any money to spare that could/should/would go towards any of these things... and i'm reminded that "the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil" (1 timothy 6:10&lt;a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1TIM+6:10&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;have you ever thought that people may have different &lt;a href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/jcb/tact.html"&gt;tact filters&lt;/a&gt;? i think jeff's got a good point, and i've certainly met the type of tact-filter-reversed geeks he's talking about (yet i don't think i am one). and it makes me think: have you noticed that there is a class of people whose subtlety filters are askew or entirely missing? i have this friend who misinterprets all forms of subtle implications, including sarcasm and flat-out "wink-wink, nudge-nudge, knowhatimean?" suggestivism... sometimes it completely passes by him; other times he gets mad at the speaker because he can't tell when it's a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in browsing about &lt;a href="http://www.aq.org/~js/"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; yesterday (linked because of the &lt;a href="http://www.aq.org/~js/places/boston/"&gt;list of boston restaurants&lt;/a&gt;), i discovered a sexual preference i'd never really heard of before, called &lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=polyamory"&gt;polyamory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.aq.org/~js/sexuality/poly-def.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;jay's definition is short and simple, but &lt;a href="http://www.polyamory.org/"&gt;this site/newsgroup&lt;/a&gt; is apparently definitive. seems like a bad idea to me&amp;#8212;it's hard enough learning to love one person! it reminds me a bit of madeline l'engle's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060652071/ewallorg"&gt;certain women&lt;/a&gt;, an odd story of a modern-day king david, his 8 wives and their children in some sort of a happy-family polygamy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;what's it gonna be&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;editor's note&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;i actually wrote this post last night, but &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt; was puking again. i really should rebuild this website with a different engine (&lt;a href="http://www.pmachine.com/"&gt;pmachine&lt;/a&gt; is starting to look interesting now).&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/editor's note&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dannyreviews.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;danny put &lt;a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/5/16/10019/7094"&gt;one of his book reviews&lt;/a&gt; on k5, announcing the release of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0865476268/ewallorg"&gt;postmodern pooh&lt;/a&gt;. building on the idea of his success of nearly 40 years ago (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0525484116/ewallorg"&gt;the pooh perplex&lt;/a&gt;) frederick crews taunts the literary critics of our day in the sincerest form of flattery&amp;#8212;criticizing the critcs and deconstructing the deconstructionists with their own arguments, if you will. as a former unhappy english major, i am sad this book didn't come out a few years earlier, or i would've quoted it in one of my papers, hoping the professor would think it profound. if you have any disdain for or knowledge of such high-brow foolishness, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.fsbassociates.com/northpointpress/postmodernpooh.htm#excerpt"&gt;excerpt&lt;/a&gt; and maybe look for the book at the library...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sunday was just a marvelous day, and god really made the day worthwhile for both ainsley and me. first off, i had to get up for the early service (ugh) at church, because i spoke quickly in both services about my excitement for the trip to central africa this summer and requested that they be praying with me. at the same time, ains was speaking at her church in yarmouth, and was quite well received and very encouraged by the response. then justin, ains &amp;amp; i took some of the young kids from the international church's sunday school out to the park for an afternoon of wild romping and foolishness. somehow we managed to get the kids home alive in time for ains &amp;amp; i to get to the north deering alliance church where my church's youth group meets, where we spoke to the senior high kids about god's heart for justice and mercy and how we should respond to that, and about &lt;a href="http://www.cav2000.org/"&gt;cav2000&lt;/a&gt;'s ministry and our trip. all day i was just praising god for making things go smoothly and allowing us to praise him in some small way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night ains &amp;amp; i went down to boston to visit with her old roommate and her girlfriend. it was a double-date at a great little vegetarian chinese restaurant called &lt;a href="http://www.aq.org/~js/places/boston/buddhas/"&gt;buddha's delight&lt;/a&gt;, which i will definitely remember for future repasts. the menu is a riot, as all the meats (or should i say "meats") are vegetarian fakes made with wheat gluten, bean curds, tofu, etc.... so the menu lists them in quotes: "pork" fried rice, "beef" with broccoli, and so on. i didn't care for the "shrimp", but the "duck" and the "pork" was yummy. oh, i should also comment that the service is less than stellar, to say the least&amp;#8212;the only water we saw was in the bathroom sink, despite efforts to get the waitress'es attention for something else to drink. oh well...&lt;/p&gt;

(if you weren't keeping track, that means that this is their sixth recording, hence the title.) i'm still not much used to this one yet as i haven't really given much play time, but then again i haven't really connected with it either. so, &lt;i&gt;caveat emptor&lt;/i&gt;, or "each to his own," or something like that...&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/76841107'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/76841107'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#76841107' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-76661768</id><published>2002-05-17T18:58:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2008-06-12T06:42:35.811+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;it's alright&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the last couple weeks have been so packed-full and i've been so stressed-out, i felt like a water balloon filling up at the faucet, ready to burst. but god has been soooo good to me (and ainsley, too!) to keep everything together and make us finish strong... i don't know where to begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's see... it includes an interesting day observing and helping at &lt;a href="http://www.mmc.org/mmcem/patients/main.html"&gt;maine medical center's emergency room&lt;/a&gt;, a delightfully easy written final for my emt class, rebuilding an important server from scratch and fighting stupid politics at work, the much-anticipated &lt;a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/"&gt;bowdoin&lt;/a&gt; spring gala dance with ains, and the class practical final ("remember, you can ace the class and still fail the final, and it's all down the tubes!"). thoughout, i've been enjoying a gift from my mom of beth moore's &lt;a href="http://www.lifeway.com/leader_wm011120.asp"&gt;living free&lt;/a&gt; bible study, &lt;a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=psalm+86&amp;language=english&amp;version=NLT"&gt;psalm 86&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=PS+25:4-6&amp;language=english&amp;version=NLT&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on"&gt;psalm 25:4-6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so much of the stress is over for me now, and will be soon for ainsley too as she's nearly finished with her final papers for bowdoin. now we can re-focus on all the other plans and activities coming up, including the trip to central africa, seminary decisions, and on and on and on... but god is good, and i am confident that he will keep on guiding us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;non-sequitur&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;the funniest link i've found in a while: satirewire's &lt;a href="http://www.satirewire.com/features/satire-jeevesinterview.shtml"&gt;interview with the search engine&lt;/a&gt;. just read it; you'll laugh.&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/non-sequitur&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night my parents came for the emt class graduation ceremony (and ainsley, of course, and lance, which was a pleasant surprise), and then stayed overnight. for some reason i've been itching to see a good movie for weeks on end (probably because i had no time for it), and so afterwards dad and i picked up spielberg's &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0212720"&gt;a.i.&lt;/a&gt;. i had heard so many mixed reviews, and they were definitely right to point out the clash between kubrick's typically depressing outlook and his original vision for the story as it contrasted with spielberg's desire for a happy ending and his sentimentality shown in the filming. but the story was certainly thought-provoking, the production and effects were excellent, and the acting from &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Osment,+Haley+Joel"&gt;haley joel osment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Law,+Jude"&gt;jude law&lt;/a&gt; (a favorite of mine) and &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?O%27Connor,+Frances+(II)"&gt;frances o'connor&lt;/a&gt; were spot-on. and it makes me think that, now that i have some more time for free-reading, i really should pick up brian aldiss' &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312280610/ewallorg"&gt;supertoys last all summer long&lt;/a&gt; (the inspiration for this movie) and phillip dick's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345404475/ewallorg"&gt;do androids dream of electric sheep?&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0083658"&gt;blade runner&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and don't forget: &lt;a href="http://www.askjeeves.com/main/metaAnswer.asp?t=m&amp;s=a&amp;qcategory=jeev&amp;en=directhit&amp;o=0&amp;frames=True&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fask%2Edirecthit%2Ecom%2Ffcgi%2Dbin%2Fredirurl%2Efcg%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eflorilegium%2Eorg%2Ffiles%2FDWELLINGS%2Fyurts%2Dmsg%2Etext%26qry%3DDidn%2527t%2Bthink%2Bso%252E%2BWell%252C%2Bthanks%2BJeeves%252C%2Bit%2Bwas%252E%252E%252E%2Benlightening%252E%26rnk%3D2%26cz%3Dec6ff9434c374272%26src%3DDH%5FASK%5FSRCH%26uid%3D043171647E1516AB3%26sid%3D1393F1D30AA425EC3%26u%3D&amp;ac=24&amp;pt=yurts%2Dmsg+%2D+5%2F12%2F01+Round+Mongol+tents+also+called+gers%2E+Referances%2E+Construction+hints%2E+NOTE%3A+See&amp;dm=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eflorilegium%2Eorg%2Ffiles%2FDWELLINGS%2Fyurts%2Dmsg%2Etext&amp;io=1&amp;qid=F50A4C8676A5784AA0B8CC5EB9E1F9D7&amp;back=ask%3DDidn%2527t%2Bthink%2Bso%2E%2BWell%252C%2Bthanks%2BJeeves%252C%2Bit%2Bwas%2E%2E%2E%2Benlightening%2E%26o%3D0%26x%3D25%26y%3D15&amp;ask=Didn%27t+think+so%2E+Well%2C+thanks+Jeeves%2C+it+was%2E%2E%2E+enlightening%2E&amp;dt=020517085737"&gt;situ is latin for site&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;let's spin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm getting no small amount of amusement in the fact that our office area's &lt;i&gt;cinco de mayo&lt;/i&gt; party is on may 7th. sometimes it's the little things that get me... (and, coincidentally, no one else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.taylor.edu/upland/alumni/"&gt;taylor alums&lt;/a&gt;, you'll get a kick out of this: i just learned that bethel has &lt;a href="http://www.bethel.edu/college/catalog/acadinfo/lifestyl/lifestyl.htm"&gt;their own version&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.taylor.edu/about/ltc/"&gt;life together covenant&lt;/a&gt;. i can't get a away from it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've been meaning to link to this article/thread on k5&lt;a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/25/13272/5729"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just because... because i love coffee. because i want to increase my love of coffee. maybe next year i should make a new year's resolution to stop drinking the sewer sludge at work and make my own quality cup in the morning. maybe at the same time i can start &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380763664/ewallorg"&gt;homebrewing&lt;/a&gt;, too (oh, shoot! what about that &lt;a href="http://www.bethel.edu/college/catalog/acadinfo/lifestyl/lifestyl.htm"&gt;ltc&lt;/a&gt;?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you hadn't noticed, i'm trying to make a concerted effort to be happy despite the stress (or maybe it's the &lt;a href="http://www.celexa.com/"&gt;celexa&lt;/a&gt; kicking in), and so today's post is more fun stuff. i don't mean to be heavy all the time... it's just all this gravity draggin' me down. (that was a pun. get it? ha!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, one more thing: the other morning i had just recently crawled out of bed and was stumbling around the apartment trying to remember how the morning routine is supposed to go (i'm not a morning person, especially lately) when i received this phone call: &lt;i&gt;[stiff machine voice] "this is your wake-up call. if you'd like to wake up, please press '1'. if you'd like to sleep in, press '2'. if you believe you have received this call in error, press '3' or press '0' to speak with an operator for all other questions."&lt;/i&gt; it was my boss, just trying to help me get in to work on time. when i pressed a button, he blurted out, "oh, wait! what button did you press? i can't tell which button you pressed!" he then was sad that he had "wasted a perfectly good skit," since i was already awake. it sure made the morning fun, though... my boss is so cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;one of these days&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;productivity-consultant &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670899240/ewallorg"&gt;david allen&lt;/a&gt; suggests that it is the many "open loops" in our lives&amp;#8212;that is, those tasks and decisions that we are storing in our heads and subconsciously worrying about all the time&amp;#8212;that significantly adds to our stress and lack of peace (i know this doesn't come as a big surprise to you). with that in mind, here are some of my "open loops" (following a loose definition, at least)... maybe that'll help you understand how stressed i am at the moment.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my emt class is drawing to a close, so in the next two weeks i have two practical exams, two written exams, one research paper, one shift to work at the &lt;a href="http://www.mmc.org/care/default.htm"&gt;hospital's e.r.&lt;/a&gt;. oh, and did i mention that i'm behind on a few chapters of reading, and i should have memorized all the steps of the practical test by tonight's class?
&lt;li&gt;at work, i've recently made a ton of changes to the web proxy environment, including switching over to a new server with &lt;a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/iplanet/products/iplanet_proxy/home_proxy.html"&gt;the latest software&lt;/a&gt; that sort of fixed a lot of problems, and caused a bunch of new ones... at least, a lot of &lt;i&gt;perceived&lt;/i&gt; new problems, that is. i spent all day yesterday and a good part of today just fighting the politics and technical aspects of this, and it hasn't been good for my job satisfaction, i must say... oh yeah, and then we wiped clean and rebuilt the old server from scratch, but i haven't really had time to finish the installations on it, because of all the complaints about the other one!
&lt;li&gt;i'm now quite serious about moving to &lt;a href="http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/"&gt;minneapolis/st. paul&lt;/a&gt; in september to start grad school. i'd really like to go visit the &lt;a href="http://www.bethel.edu/seminary/bsphome.htm"&gt;seminary&lt;/a&gt; as soon as possible, but how am i going to get the time away from work? and how do i start looking for a job? a place to live? how does one go about moving to minnesota and getting a &lt;a href="http://www.dps.state.mn.us/dvs/"&gt;driver's license&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.emsrb.state.mn.us/"&gt;emt-b certification&lt;/a&gt;, etc? and how do i tune to &lt;a href="http://www.mpr.org/"&gt;npr&lt;/a&gt; in the twin cities? and ainsley is considering the same questions...
&lt;li&gt;my boss talked with his boss about my proposal to take a leave of absence from work during july for my trip to &lt;a href="http://allafrica.com/centralafrica/"&gt;central africa&lt;/a&gt;. now the rumor is that the request may be refused, meaning that i would have to quit my job before leaving! so then, how would the money and the move go after that? could i work elsewhere here in portland for the month of august? if i did contract work, i probably wouldn't get paid for a while, which would be too late.
&lt;li&gt;and what about my apartment when i go to africa? should i try to pack everything up for shipping and see if i can live with some friends for the few weeks between africa and moving?
&lt;li&gt;on the schedule: doctor's appointments for shots, headaches, depression... (my health insurance must think i'm a basket case!). ainsley's graduation and family visiting. weddings, weddings, weddings. (not mine!)
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;phew! that felt good to get all that out...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw, our workshop at the &lt;a href="http://home.psouth.net/smcec/"&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; went quite well, and i really enjoyed the interaction with the attendees. i also had a very encouraging conversation with a fellow named shawn whom i'd met when he was applying for a youth director position at &lt;a href="http://www.midcoast.com/~chestnut/"&gt;my dad's church&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;just like u said it would b&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="oh no, i think his heart stopped!" src="/weblog/pics/groomcpr.jpg" align="right"&gt;yesterday afternoon i returned from a very pleasant weekend in &lt;a href="http://visitcalais.com/"&gt;calais, maine&lt;/a&gt; (population: 4,000), for a friend's wedding. the five of us who came up from portland and spent much of the weekend together had such a good time that we nearly forgot about all the stresses and worries that awaited us back home. i'm thanking god both for the successful wedding (the couple are hitched now, and that's what we came to do!) and for the much-needed rest. the picture (courtesy of dave c.) is of us performing cpr on the all-too-nervous groom...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that done, i am now focusing my attention on the &lt;a href="http://home.psouth.net/smcec/"&gt;southern maine christian education conference&lt;/a&gt; coming up this saturday, for which we (the syzygus facilitators) are leading a workshop entitled, "from individually-wrapped to equally yoked". (i am not making this up! however, i will confess to having a part in choosing the title... but troy is really the one who made it up, so blame him.) the workshop is on ministering specifically to the "singles" crowd (that's what they asked us to speak on), although we are careful to state that we don't particularly care for the "singles group"-type programs, and our experience is with young adults (namely, syzygus). &lt;a href="http://home.psouth.net/smcec/aws2.html"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; (towards the bottom) has the full abstract on our topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;talked with &lt;a href="http://www.ppefc.org/"&gt;my church&lt;/a&gt;'s youth director this morning, and am now set to speak to the &lt;a href="http://members.truepath.com/ppefc/"&gt;youth group&lt;/a&gt; about my trip to central africa with &lt;a href="http://www.cav2000.org/"&gt;cav 2000&lt;/a&gt; this summer. i feel that one of the places i am best suited to serve the body of christ (and particularly in my somewhat
limited interaction with payson park e-free church) is to act as a catalyst to stir up passion for knowing god's heart and participating in his work. the men's breakfast on the saturday before last was one example of it (and a real success, i think), and the upcoming opportunities to speak to the church about god's passion for justice and mercy and our response are more ways that i can share the excitement. (so if you're in portland, come to payson park on the morning of may 19th.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am so tired tonight, but before i go to bed i'm going to do one more thing: i need to find the &lt;a href="http://www.bethel.edu/seminary/"&gt;bethel seminary&lt;/a&gt; cd-rom i received, and look into their &lt;a href="http://www.bethel.edu/seminary/catalog/StPaul/bsmatl.htm"&gt;m.a. in transformational leadership&lt;/a&gt; program. i am not too thrilled with the location of the school, but this program sounds right up my alley. if i am really to leave for seminary/graduate school this fall, i'd better start getting a little closer to making decisions and sending in applications soon!&lt;/p&gt;

(also, may i gripe for a moment at the audacity of some musicians&amp;#8212;including sinead, rod stewart, susan ashton...&amp;#8212;to title their "best of" albums something like "so far...", as if they're certain that they'll have more hits to come?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's one a.m. on april 16th, and i still can't get my taxes through &lt;a href="http://www.irs.gov/efile/display/0,,i1%3D51&amp;genericId%3D15025,00.html"&gt;e-file&lt;/a&gt; (motto: "filing your taxes was never easier"&amp;#8212;they should've left off the superlative, i think). i know what you're thinking: &lt;i&gt;oh no, what horrible penalties await my dear friend eric, who is late in filing his taxes?&lt;/i&gt; well&amp;#8212;ha-ha!&amp;#8212;you see, in maine and massachusetts we have this strange holiday, called "patriot's day", that no one knows anything about. (despite new england's renewed adoration of the patriots football team, the holiday has nothing to do with pigskins.) so anyway, &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42181-2002Apr13.html"&gt;we get until tuesday, april 16th, to file our taxes&lt;/a&gt;... had you worried for a minute there, didn't i?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/weblog/pics/green_eggs_sm.jpg" alt="green eggs! what a hoot!" align="left"&gt;did you know that there's a certain kind of chicken that lays green eggs? i am &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; making this up! one of the guys from my church has his own chickens, so he supplied all the eggs when our "man club" cooked breakfast as an advertisement (rather, an exhortation) for accountability groups for the payson park guys on saturday morning. i'll have to ask him again what kind of chicken it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maybe i should just go to bed and try to e-file my taxes in the morning... that bed is looking awfully comfortable right now...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh yes, and i should mention that the "fresh" garlic in my fridge is sprouting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;got out of class tonight nearly 2 hours early. i've done anything but taxes so far this evening, including fixing up my website a little by editing my cascading style sheet (with a little help from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565926226/ewallorg"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;). you might notice that the spacing of lists (see &lt;a href="http://www.ewall.org/weblog/archives/show.php?blog=2002_04_07_index.inc#75306556"&gt;this morning's post&lt;/a&gt; below) and special formatting (like the spam mail in &lt;a href="http://www.ewall.org/weblog/archives/show.php?blog=2002_03_10_index.inc#10632604"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post) is much improved. it's the little details that matter... hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/75310884'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/75310884'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#75310884' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-75306556</id><published>2002-04-12T03:14:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2002-04-12T05:06:09.000+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;golden slumbers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p class="noindent"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;editor's note&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;i wrote this entry this morning, but &lt;a href="http://status.blogger.com"&gt;blogger was a bit 'blogged up&lt;/a&gt;, so to speak...&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/editor's note&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;woah... i haven't written here in weeks, but not for lack of things to write. rather, it was lack of time to write them down, especially as they stack up... well, here's a start, at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

random list of recent events in my life which may or may not interest you:&lt;dl&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;no &lt;a href="http://www.subscriberx.com/.SRX?Service=SRXLeaflet&amp;Function=GetLeaflet&amp;DrugId=6437&amp;Dialect=English"&gt;zanaflex&lt;/a&gt; for me&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;i gave up on the medicine "solution" to the tension headaches, and will be trying biofeedback with someone named &lt;a href="http://www.holisticopia.com/world/view.php?ID=197981"&gt;patricia bitterman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;rare tropical disease&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;i've been in for a follow-up on the mysterious condition which has been making me so tired all the time. i seem to be feeling a little better lately, maybe in part due to the vacation last week... we tried even more tests, but the prevailing theory now is an approaching depression, which i'm making efforts to head off before it gets any worse. of course, the doctor's solution is: &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/rxlist.cgi?drug=Celexa"&gt;more drugs&lt;/a&gt;! oh yeah, and i think my car is leaking exhaust into the passenger compartment (do you know how long carbon monoxide stays bound to your hemoglobin? i have almost the exact symptoms of &lt;a href="http://www.coheadquarters.com/ChronicCO/indexchronic2.htm"&gt;chronic carbon monoxide poisoning&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;vacation? what's that?&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;i took my mandatory 40 hours off last week, and spent half the time up in camden alone at my parent's house while they were away, and them back home. i meant to "power relax" for the first few days, and then get to work on taxes, computers, etc. but i ended up sleeping and reading the whole week away. i finally began to feel a bit relaxed on saturday, just in time to get busy again.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.debian.org/intro/about#what"&gt;debian gnu-linux&lt;/a&gt; gnus&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/testing/"&gt;woody&lt;/a&gt; is the up-and-coming release for the very stable but stuffy linux distro (or, &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html"&gt;gnu-linux&lt;/a&gt;, as they would rather you say). it's almost ready for primetime, which is definitely good news for stability wonks such as myself. however, the &lt;a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/woody/main/disks-i386/current/images-1.44/bf2.4/README.txt"&gt;bf2.4&lt;/a&gt; kernel doesn't seem to like the pcmcia bus on my laptop, so i need to try a few more tricks... how tedious.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;can you spare a circuit or two?&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;i need to tear apart one of my older computers, give away some of the hardware, and rebuild it as a &lt;a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/4.5R/announce.html"&gt;freebsd 4.5&lt;/a&gt; server for file shares, proxying and vpn access at home. for those of you waiting for parts: i'm working on it, really. right after i finish my taxes!&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;moveable blog&lt;dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;i'm thinking of giving up on &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="http://pro.blogger.com"&gt;blogger pro&lt;/a&gt;) and going to &lt;a href="http://www.moveabletype.org"&gt;moveabletype&lt;/a&gt;, if i can get my isp to cooperate with the &lt;a href="http://perl.apache.org/"&gt;mod_perl&lt;/a&gt; settings. (of, and for those of you who remember that i had to rewrite my &lt;a href="http://www.ewall.org/dilbert.php"&gt;catch-up-on-dilbert script&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.php.net"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;php because perl wasn't working right? it turns out that the only problem was that my isp had mod_perl as default handler for .pl files, and if i'd only renamed the non-threadsafe files they would have worked fine.) and, of course, the whole web site needs an overhaul during the process, but it'll be good, i promise...&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;talk about my girl&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;ainsley &amp;amp; i celebrate ten months together tomorrow night... woah. i know that doesn't sound like long, but two people can grow pretty darn close during such an intense time (think of it in infant months, maybe: &lt;i&gt;tens month, oh how they've grown!&lt;/i&gt;). god has been so amazingly good to us by packing in plenty of challenges to grow through and joys to keep us going. i am in awe, and i thank my lord every day for such a blessing.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;i'd better stop &lt;a href="http://www.bayarea.com/mld/bayarea/entertainment/3029974.htm"&gt;sharing mp3's at work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;and speaking of work: i should get back to it. so much to do, so little time. but first, some lunch!&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;now and then&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i should be studying now, but i don't have any energy left for that. we've got a review session tomorrow based on the gameshow &lt;a href="http://www.weakestlink.com/"&gt;the weakest link&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;which i of course know nothing about since my tv isn't hooked up to any kind of antenna or cable service (movies and taped &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/"&gt;austin city limits&lt;/a&gt; only)&amp;#8212;and then thursday is the mid-term exam, but i'm not worried. &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;sarcasm&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;i am the model of stress-free productivity.&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/sarcasm&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, so some people don't think i'm anywhere near "stress-free", and i daresay that my productivity of late has been lacking (i blame the mysterious tropical disease which seems to have sapped all my energy and mailed it to an anonymous post-office box in some backwater town in louisiana). one of them is georgann, my &lt;a href="http://maineneurology.neurohub.net/staff.html"&gt;neurologist&lt;/a&gt; (does it worry you that i have a neurologist?), who has been having my try different meds to try to deal with the cause of my tension headaches (rather than just the symptoms). contrary to popular opinion, "tension headaches" do not necessarily have anything to do with either stress or muscle tension, however in my case there is probably some correlation. the last drug we tried was &lt;a href="http://www.subscriberx.com/.SRX?Service=SRXLeaflet&amp;Function=GetLeaflet&amp;DrugId=12079&amp;Dialect=English"&gt;nortriptyline&lt;/a&gt;, which was rather successful in assisting my normally insomniac-ish sleep, but entirely useless in reducing the frequency of the headaches.(and for a time i was blaming it for the symptoms of the "rare tropical disease" mentioned earlier, but that has proven wrong since i've stopped the meds.) the next attempt, &lt;a href="http://www.subscriberx.com/.SRX?Service=SRXLeaflet&amp;Function=GetLeaflet&amp;DrugId=6437&amp;Dialect=English"&gt;zanaflex&lt;/a&gt;, will be less mentally affective, rather physically reducing the chemical and neurological messages that make my back muscles' contracted and tense all the time. as the similar drug &lt;a href="http://www.subscriberx.com/.SRX?Service=SRXLeaflet&amp;Function=GetLeaflet&amp;DrugId=1837&amp;Dialect=English"&gt;flexeril&lt;/a&gt; has proven somewhat helpful, i'm just a tiny bit more hopeful about this one, but not much. i'm once again leaning away from the drug solutions towards more natural, physical solutions. the problem is that, in the past, attempts such as stretching and neck-specific exercises have only made the headaches worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ainsley also thinks that my reactions to stress might be a part of the tension and the headaches. my neurologist described a process called biofeedback which assists some people with controlling their own psychosomatic responses (good intro &lt;a href="http://www.psychotherapy.com/bio.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and more details &lt;a href="http://www.aapb.org/public/articles/index.cfm?Cat=2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and explained how it had helped her son as early as age 11 to deal with adhd-type stress. when she described her son and other hypertense personalities that might benefit from biofeedback, ains was certain that i fit the profile. as i'm already expecting the new meds to be insufficient and/or inappropriate, after the two-week trial i think i'll give this biofeedback idea a shot. another possibility which i'm not quite warmed up to, however, is &lt;a href="http://www.botox.com/index.jsp?cc&amp;faq"&gt;botox injections&lt;/a&gt; in the cramped muscles of my back and neck, which another doctor at that office is fond of and able to perform. again, i think i perfer the more natural, less medicated approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, i started writing this post hours ago, and have gotten all kinds of other things done in the meantime (which is great), but now it's quite late (or early in the morning, you could say) and i have another doctor's appointment first thing tomorrow (that rare tropical disease, you know...). and i wanted to prep some more memorization verses in time for tomorrow night's meeting with the missions board at my church (more on that later, hopefully). but for now, goodnight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sandramccracken.com"&gt;sandra mccracken&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://www.grassrootsmusic.com/album.php?id=610"&gt;gypsy flat road&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; this independent album was highly recommended by the folks over at &lt;a href="http://www.grassrootsmusic.com/"&gt;grassroots music&lt;/a&gt;, so i listened to the sound clips and ordered the disc on a whim. today i'm so glad i found it&amp;#8212;i'm already in love with the album, after one listen! the style is folk-rock/bluegrass/country, with clean and subtle instrumentation and artful production by jonathan trebing and sandra herself, and a voice somewhere between favorites &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/10/21/harris/"&gt;emmylou harris&lt;/a&gt; and shawn colvin&lt;a href="http://www.shawncolvin.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (really!). also, the lyrics are poetic in a simple, understated manner&amp;#8212;not bad for someone who sings, "i've never been good with my thoughts and even worse with my words" (from "springtime indiana," which is apparently a beautiful tribute to her husband). i'm already spinning the cd again, so you can't borrow mine yet&amp;#8212;but you just might want to get your own copy. (oh, for all you hoosiers out there: it looks like she's playing in indy on may 18th, according to &lt;a href="http://www.grassrootsmusic.com/concerts/index.php?artist=41"&gt;this listing&lt;/a&gt;. i'm jealous!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i keep a junk account on &lt;a href="http://mail.yahoo.com"&gt;yahoo! mail&lt;/a&gt;, and that's the address i use for software registrations, contests, etc. so it gets a lot of &lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=spam"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt; (i bet you didn't think that word was in the dictionary!). recently i got one of the more disturbing offers i've read in a while, so i'll repeat it here almost entirely. (joshua, this is even scarier than the 24-hour online church!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
WE ARE a U.S. based international ministry that wants to provide you with the 
credentials you need to serve as a legal minister.

WE BELIEVE that ordination should be given to all who ask. One of the benefits 
of being a LEGAL member of the clergy is that you are authorized to perform the 
rites and ceremonies of the church.

They include:

WEDDINGS - You can earn part-time income officiating marriages. Couples are 
searching for wedding officiates. Most states require that you register your 
certificate (THAT WE SEND YOU) prior to conducting the ceremony. Some pastors work 
full-time as wedding officiates, so can you! And we'll put you in our database 
of officiates - we receive thousands of requests for ordained ministers!

FUNERALS - The simple fact is that people die every day, providing a 
never-ending need for funeral officiates.

BAPTISMS - What a special way to welcome a child of God. As millions return to 
church and desire these official ceremonies, you are there to assist them! This 
adds to your part or full-time income as a minister!

PRISON MINISTRIES - Since you will be a Certified Minister, you can visit 
others in need. Assist those who are ready to CHANGE their lives - You can play a 
major part in that decision!

HOSPITOL MINISTRIES - As an ordained clergy, you can be listed with most 
hospitals and conduct a successful hospital ministry.

WANT TO START YOUR OWN CHURCH? After your ordination, you may start your own 
congregation! We can offer much assistance as you begin your new place of 
worship.

WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING? "You are truly an answer to prayer for myself and for 
hundreds, if not thousands, of men who have been frustrated with constitution, 
laws, and by-laws of most denominations who have denied brethren who have 
answered the call of God." - Colorado Springs, Colorado., "We've been wanting to take 
communion during the weeks we are without a Priest, and now we are able to do 
that." - Greenwith, Australia

&lt;p&gt;i'm sorry that my writing here has been sporadic and often impersonal lately. i suppose there are two legitimate reasons: first that i'm super busy with this emt course on top of everything else, and second that i'm still reluctant to speak too personally in such a forum. suffice it to say that i'm doing well, but ainsley and i are certainly under a lot of stress this semester, and we're depending on God for each breath... thankfully, He's been overwhelmingly good to us, and our relationships with each other and with the Lord are stronger than ever now. i am in constant awe of His work in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i passed the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/exams/70-217.asp"&gt;active directory infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; exam today, so i'm two-fifths (or four-sevenths, depending on how you count it) of the way to "upgrading" to the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/mcp/mcse/requirements.asp"&gt;mcse for win2k&lt;/a&gt;. furthermore, i am wiped out... it was a rather gruelling two hours for 63 questions, and they (micro$oft) stopped telling test-takers their actual scores, so i don't even know if i passed by a good margin or by the skin of my teeth (which, if my dentist has anything to say about it, should have very little skin content). ugh. at least the remaining few exams should be easier compared to this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;note to self&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;watch &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119177"&gt;gattaca&lt;/a&gt; again sometime soon. then read &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7756-2002Feb26.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; (found on &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/02/27/2022218&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=134"&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, of course) again. compare and consider.&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/note to self&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for some interesting reading, check out &lt;a href="http://www.b-may.com/"&gt;b-may's blog&lt;/a&gt; for his stories of working security at the &lt;a href="http://www.saltlake2002.com/"&gt;2002 winter olympics&lt;/a&gt;. february 16th's entry with the best quote he'd heard so far was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i love my &lt;a href="http://www.panasonic.com/PCSC/PTSC/promax.htm"&gt;panasonic promax cell phone&lt;/a&gt;, and was disturbed when &lt;a href="http://www.attws.com/"&gt;at&amp;amp;t wireless&lt;/a&gt; stopped selling it. then i was a bit more disturbed as i started to have strange dropouts&amp;#8212;for example, i'd be standing there holding the phone with 100% reception, and it would beep to tell me that somone had just left a voice mail message only seconds before. anyway, sharon (an ever-helpful coworker) managed to get the warranty people to replace it, and although we originally thought they'd replace it with one of the new models, they still went with the promax. at first i was disappointed, wondering whether a replacement for a product that won't be in production much longer is really going to be supportable; on the other hand, my spare battery and other accessories only fit this phone, so i guess i shouldn't complain. but the best part is that they said this was only the first warranty replacement they'd had to do for this model!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don't think &lt;a href="http://www.colorgenics.com/"&gt;colorgenics&lt;/a&gt; is going to be earning &lt;a href="http://www.paulgoldin.com/"&gt;paul goldin&lt;/a&gt; any nobel prizes for social science. it looks like another personality test/horiscope scam that lets you "see yourself as you really are," entirely based on the order in which you pick a few colors. below are some of the totally ridiculous "facts" about me it came up with when i color-picked the other day. (if you know me, you'll find &lt;a href="http://www.colorgenics.com/color.php?c0=6&amp;c1=2&amp;c2=4&amp;c3=3&amp;c4=5&amp;c5=1&amp;c6=0&amp;c7=7"&gt;my whole colorgenics profile&lt;/a&gt; to be quite a laugh.)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in spite of the fact that you feel like "giving up"...
&lt;li&gt;you have a short fuse and are likely to take offence for the slightest reason.
&lt;li&gt;you feel very lonely and frustrated at this time, but your shyness and modesty precludes you from establishing any deep form of relationship.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this evening ains and i are going to sanford to visit an old friend of mine, krystal, and her husband and son. (by "old friend" i don't mean that she's old&amp;#8212;although knowing people my age with kids sometimes boggles me, but i shouldn't be surprised&amp;#8212;rather, that she and i have been friends for a long time, and it's been a few years since we've talked, too.) i'm really quite excited and looking forward to a fun evening, so i'll be off now...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;everyday i write the book&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a-ha! i knew that there were benefits to my life-long insomnia. (by "life-long" i'm not implying that i've been awake my entire life, rather that i have had trouble sleeping for most of it!) slashdot today linked to &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12305-2002Feb14.html"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that people who sleep less than eight hours a day will live longer than those lazy folks who sleep in. (another unmentioned benefit is that we short-sleepers are awake much more of our lives than the snoozers, too... i'll have none of this spending one third of my lifetime sleeping!) oh, and for those of you who care, i think my body is finally getting used to the new meds, so i'm not having so much trouble getting up in the morning anymore. if this study is true, then i probably shaved a few seconds off my life expectancy in the last couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and to give me more reason to stay up nights this week, my boss and i decided this morning that, since i don't have my emt classes this week, i should take the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/exams/70-217.asp"&gt;win2k directory services&lt;/a&gt; exam this friday. i already started studying the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576106888/ewallorg"&gt;examcram book&lt;/a&gt; at lunch, and tonight i'll be at the &lt;a href="http://www.founddesign.com/javanet3.htm"&gt;coffee shop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;geek stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt; find out anything about anyone! despite what the spam tells you (i mean &lt;a href="http://www.cauce.org/"&gt;unsolicited commercial email&lt;/a&gt;, not the &lt;a href="http://www.spam.com/"&gt;beloved semi-edible potted meat product&lt;/a&gt;), email marketing doesn't really work. the title "find out anything about anyone!" sure is intriguing, but do we really want to know? well, anyway... today one of the security tool mailing lists i'm on suggested a couple tools that may be interesting...
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winwhatwhere.com/w3i4/index.htm"&gt;winwhatwhere&lt;/a&gt; is a somewhat-sneaky "computer activity monitor", not unlike &lt;a href="http://www.bo2k.com/"&gt;backorifice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.visualware.com/visualroute/index.html"&gt;visualroute&lt;/a&gt; attempts to trace an ip address back on the map by using whois, etc. to determine where hosting companies are located. and now you can use this tool online for free at &lt;a href="http://security.symantec.com/"&gt;symantec's security site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.visualware.com/emailtrackerpro/index.html"&gt;emailtrackerpro&lt;/a&gt; reads email header information to try to trace back to the sender, even for anonymous or spoofed senders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i often wonder about the dubious idea of calling &lt;a href="http://www.winwhatwhere.com/w3i4/index.htm"&gt;winwhatwhere&lt;/a&gt; a "security tool." i should think that many information security folks would be wary of using such a tool lest they be accused of &lt;a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/04140.html"&gt;entrapment&lt;/a&gt; when they do try to nab someone. but no doubt many others would enjoy this software for its "entertainment value" (a.k.a. possibly illicit use).&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/geek stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know, i have been thinking about remaking the guts of this website for a while, partially due to my nearly insatiable appetite for new computing challenges, and partially due to my occasional frustration with weblog-provider &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt;. i was seriously considering &lt;a href="http://geeklog.sourceforge.net/"&gt;geeklog&lt;/a&gt; for the engine, and maybe writing my own bit for the little-used input/output category (with php and mysql, of course). now i realize that i just don't have time for that kind of a project, so i may just break down and upgrade to &lt;a href="http://pro.blogger.com/"&gt;blogger pro&lt;/a&gt;. when i finally do that, i'll probably overhaul some of the site anyway, with better weblog archives, a search engine (for all my ego-surfing friends), and maybe even a slightly updated graphic theme. but don't hold your breath...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;come talk to me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my lady is so great... i'm home from work today because i was ill (mostly last night, really), and she just surprised me by dropping by to see me on her way to work. what a sweetie!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since i've had a fairly quiet day today, i got a chance to catch up on some reading, including my "lifetime subscription" to &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/"&gt;the atlantic monthly&lt;/a&gt;. last month had some thought-provoking articles, including one on &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2002/01/bellin.htm"&gt;how people give away their poker game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2002/01/nehring.htm"&gt;a critical review of a handful of dating/mating advice books&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2002/01/gordon.htm"&gt;a lengthy article on modern-day nuns&lt;/a&gt; (admittedly, i haven't read that one yet, so i can't necessarily recommend it). what a great magazine...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; peter gabriel's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=298733"&gt;secret world live&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; mmm, good! peter manages to his well-crafted music from the albums to the live performance. suddenly you remember that he is a keyboard player, because he gets more chance to play it in concert with less additional instrumentation. highly recommended, even if you think you don't like peter gabriel. oh and yes, that is &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/pagename=/RP/CDN/FIND/discography.html/ArtistID=COLE*PAULA"&gt;paula cole&lt;/a&gt; you hear singing with him, before she started off on the solo career. (whatever happened to her, anyway? and who kidnapped her and recorded &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=795118"&gt;amen&lt;/a&gt; in her place? maybe she was burned up in &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=374445"&gt;this fire&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;faithfully dangerous&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;survived my (rather dull) emt class tonight, and decided to take a rare trip to the grocery store (i'm a bachelor, can't you tell? i do half of my food shopping at riteaid, and the other half is out to eat). &lt;a href="http://www.hannaford.com/"&gt;hannaford&lt;/a&gt; (new theme song: "hannaford: we never stop... despising you! hannaford: we never stop... defiling you!") has changed a lot since it used to be "slop 'n slave": now they have sushi! for only a measley hour's wage you can purchase some of the finest hand-rolled sushi that can be mass-produced in superstore. now where's that &lt;a href="http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/mistovich/chapter21/deluxe.html"&gt;chapter about stomach-pumping&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;did i mention that a couple of weeks ago i became an &lt;a href="http://www.epinions.com/"&gt;epinions.com&lt;/a&gt; addict? it all started when i wanted to &lt;a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_51548688004"&gt;rant about a particular car rental company that i had problems with&lt;/a&gt;, and then i kinda got stuck on the idea. now if i could just keep up with it, it could be fun (although i don't really expect any profit from it, like they &lt;a href="http://www.epinions.com/help/faq/?show=faq_earnings"&gt;advertise&lt;/a&gt;). anyway, if you're really bored, you could check out what i've written so far under the pseudonym &lt;a href="http://www.epinions.com/user-erant"&gt;erant&lt;/a&gt; (that's like e-rant, not errant!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i should be in bed now... especially considering that since i started taking &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/frame/display.cgi?drug=NORTRIPTYLINE"&gt;nortriptyline&lt;/a&gt; to try to control the tension headaches, i just &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; get up in the morning. you'd think that a drug which is supposed to be an antidepressant (in higher quantities) would help stop those depression-related symptoms like being unable to get up in the morning! (anyway, for those who care: the jury's still out on how these new meds are going to help or harm... i'll keep you informed.) so goodnight, and sleep well...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://www.drewvogel.com/whatittakestopleaseyou.php"&gt;what it takes to please you: a tribute to over the rhine&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; a pair of &lt;a href="http://www.cincypost.com/"&gt;cincy&lt;/a&gt; fellows named &lt;a href="http://www.drewvogel.com/"&gt;drew vogel&lt;/a&gt; and bruce lachey apparently shared a passion for &lt;a href="http://www.overtherhine.com/"&gt;over the rhine&lt;/a&gt;'s music much like mine (they're one of the few things that i'm downright fanatic about), so some time ago they asked the fans to record their favorite otr songs for a tribute album. well, the long-awaited album has arrived, and is available for the small fee which goes to the charity group &lt;a href="http://www.cintishares.com/"&gt;greater cincinatti community shares&lt;/a&gt;. linford and karin were &lt;a href="http://overtherhine.com/story/newsarchive/news2002.html"&gt;"moved and humbled"&lt;/a&gt; to listen to the recording, and (although i'm not necessarily having the same reaction) i'm enjoying it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in my last post i mentioned that my class had been moved due to a fire on the campus. well, now i have &lt;a href="http://burpee.smtc.net/Preble_Hall_1-29-02/album1.html"&gt;proof&lt;/a&gt;. the first picture is a great shot of &lt;a href="http://burpee.smtc.net/Preble_Hall_1-29-02/b8.jpg"&gt;toasted computers&lt;/a&gt;. hope they had good insurance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;geek stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/4.5R/relnotes-i386.html"&gt;freebsd 4.5&lt;/a&gt; has been released. i just finished a mini-install and locked it down a bit&amp;#8212;it's so refreshing to have an open source distro come out of the box relatively secure. so now i'm portscanning it to see what i can get out of it; for some odd reason, it installed sendmail (and allows relaying!) even though i thought i turned that off. maybe next time i'll pay more attention when i do the install.&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/geek stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this lasik surgery thing is a hoot... every morning i wake, open my eyes and say to myself, "oh no, i went to sleep with my contacts in again!" then i slap myself on the head and fall back on the pillow for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyway, i should be moving on... we're trying to figure out if the weather (status: awful) is reasonably safe to drive in, because i'm supposed to pick up keith, drive up to bowdoin for bcf and a concert, then drive back tonight. so i'm off in seach of inclimate weather driving advisories...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in today's installment, we have both geeky and personal stuff. sorry it's been so long since i posted here; if you read on you'll understand a bit of how busy i am...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;geek stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/01/28/2037256.shtml"&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt; this morning had a bit on &lt;a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/internet_data/index.html"&gt;verizon's brand new 3g wireless network(s) for voice and data&lt;/a&gt; across a few areas of the u.s. as it turns out, we lucky people here in portland, maine, can get access to their &lt;a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/express_network/index.html"&gt;"express network" (1xRTT)&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="http://www.sierrawireless.com/ProductsOrdering/AC550-5551xRTT.html"&gt;sierra wireless aircard 555&lt;/a&gt; for the laptop or a cable to a 1xRTT-enabled phone, bursting up to 144 kbps. what we can't yet get up here is their &lt;a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/mobile_ip/index.html"&gt;"mobile ip" (CDPD)&lt;/a&gt; network with the cool &lt;a href="http://www.novatelwireless.com/pcproducts/merlinplatinum.htm"&gt;novatel wireless merlin platinum&lt;/a&gt; pc-card for both laptops and pocket pc handhelds, but i suppose that's okay because the 1xRTT should be the better of the two networks, i guess. how cool is it that the little city of portland (the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; portland) has had &lt;a href="http://www.rr.com/"&gt;road runner cable modems&lt;/a&gt; (super-fast compared to most dsl or cable providers, but not so great service) from early on, but now we're among the first to have reasonable third-generation wireless voice/data networks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i suppose i also haven't mentioned that my boss got me a cool toy: the &lt;a href="http://www.compaq.com/products/handhelds/pocketpc/H3850.html"&gt;compaq ipaq h3850&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mobile/pocketpc/default.asp"&gt;pocket pc 2002&lt;/a&gt;. i've never really liked micro$oft's "windoze ce" as a heldheld operating system&amp;#8212;there's no need for all the windoze-like functions and interface features when you just want to do quick-and-easy tasks on a pda (which is what the &lt;a href="http://www.palm.com"&gt;palm os&lt;/a&gt; was designed to do). nonetheless, ppc 2002 (a.k.a. windows ce 3.0) is an improvement, and the fancy color ipaq is a fun toy so far&amp;#8212;it just hasn't proved it's usefullness yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last week i installed a &lt;a href="http://www.compaq.com/products/servers/proliantdl360/index.html"&gt;compaq proliant dl360&lt;/a&gt; "blade" server for the facilities group at work, and i continue to be impressed with compaq's great tools like &lt;a href="http://www.compaq.com/products/servers/SmartStart/"&gt;smartstart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.compaq.com/products/servers/management/cim-xe.html"&gt;insight manager&lt;/a&gt;, as well as with the hardware of this inch-and-a-half tall server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and one more thing for you techno-guys out there... this one actually crosses the line from being computer-geeky to rather tough and cool, too: the new &lt;a href="http://www.maximog.com"&gt;maximog expedition system&lt;/a&gt;. it's a real all-terrain vehicle meant for serious explorers with serious survival needs (and serious cash flow), and it looks like the coolest four-wheeled vehicle ever to get mud on it. wow... i can just see myself as the "ub&amp;euml;r-missionary" unhindered by any rough african terrain...
&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/geek stuff&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've been plenty busy lately, since i started a &lt;a href="http://www.nremt.org/EMT-Basic/main.htm"&gt;emt-b&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. emergeny medical technician, basic level) course at southern maine technical college&lt;/a&gt;. it's a ton of work, but it's so interesting and practical to have emergency medical skills (that's the primary reason for me); my only concern with it is that i don't intend to make this my life, as it is or will be for many in the class. incidentally, i would link to the smtc web site, but it's down today as they had a fire consume one of the buildings this morning and cut power to the campus; regular classes are cancelled, but no surprise that my class has been moved to &lt;a href="http://www.mmc.org/"&gt;the hospital&lt;/a&gt; so we can still work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ainsley has started her remaining 4 courses at &lt;a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/"&gt;bowdoin&lt;/a&gt;, and the new job at the &lt;a href="http://www.educate.com/"&gt;sylvan learning center&lt;/a&gt; is working out great. (a couple weeks ago her new boss kept saying, "it's like you're an answer to prayer or something!" little did she know that the job was an answer to prayer!) this means that she and i are taking every spare moment for studying and don't much get to see each other through the weekdays, but then enjoy some time together on the weekends. oh, and she's driving joon (my old escort), and it's great that someone's getting some good use out of the car. and there's probably a ton of other things i'm not mentioning, but suffice it to say that we're keeping busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my lasik surgery was a huge success, and now i'm seeing better than 20/20 without any glasses or contacts, and i'm totally amazed. night driving is going to be annoying for a few months yet, as my corneas are still healing and my pupils are still extra-dialated. my one complaint is that many of the people who'd had it done told me that the only uncomfortable part of the surgery is when they put in the "occulator" that holds your eyelids back; well, i disagree&amp;#8212;it's what comes immediately &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; that is freaky, especially if you realize what they're doing at that moment! but anyway, i did not go blind, and in fact my recovery has been perfect, so there's another satisfied customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, i should be moving on to some work now...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bj&amp;ouml;rk's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1412382"&gt;vespertine&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; this is one of the best album's of 2001, in my opinion at least. i'm still waiting for a fully working copy, though&amp;#8212;the first 2 discs i got had manufacturer's defects which broke the last track! this icelander continues to impress and amaze us with her creativity and productivity. keep an eye for her live performances on various tv spots&amp;#8212;you'll be impressed, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/01/03/2039218&amp;mode=thread"&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt; the other day: "cisco has demonstrated thier &lt;a href="http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/ts_122701.html"&gt;latest last mile technology&lt;/a&gt;, and not only can you now have 10mb ethernet over cat3, cat2, cat1, try lamp power cord, battery jumper terminals, barbed wire, etc...."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sorry... last time i promised i'd tell you more about my vaca in chicago, but i won't tonight. just one more thing i wanted to mention here now: today i had my pre-op for &lt;a href="http://www.seewithlasik.com/docs/index2.shtml"&gt;lasik surgery&lt;/a&gt; (laser-beaming away bits of the cornea to fix near/farsightedness) at &lt;a href="http://www.lasik-maine.com"&gt;eyecaremed&lt;/a&gt; (isn't that a cute name?). everything went fine and i'm a good candidate for a successful operation, so that's no worry. it was the side effect that really had me amused: you see, they put these drops in to let my pupils dialate fully, but the drops also numbed the muscles that manipulate the lens inside the eye, which left me with fixed focus. it was rather strange to see myself with huge pupils and the slighest ring of color around them, but it was much more strange for me to realize that i couldn't make my eyes focus right. without my glasses, i could read somewhere between 12 and 18 inches from my face (farther away then normal, actually), and with my glasses i could only see clearly at a distance of 30 feet to 250 feet or so. all afternoon i was like this, so my kind friends dave &amp;amp; kim picked me up from the doctor's office and fed me lunch, then later keith drove me around looking for a place to fix my old escort's windshield. now hours later i can finally focus properly, but i still have deer eyes with big, black pupils... i can't get over how odd it has felt. you can bet i'm going to have some strange dreams tonight, after this trippy day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; jennifer knapp's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=444705"&gt;kansas&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; not one to usually follow christian pop, i admit that i kind of liked this album despite myself the first few times i heard it at dave &amp;amp; kim's house. so today i convinced them to make me a copy (&lt;i&gt;yes, it's legal&lt;/i&gt;), and dave even made me a color label for it with a freaky picture of me playing an acoustic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;you know that (is nothing new)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ah, &lt;a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/277.html"&gt;new year's resolutions&lt;/a&gt;... i usually ignore them, as i figure if it's important enough i'll do them anyway, so why do i need a special day to reconsider such things? well, for a handful of reasons i've ended up with a short list of personal resolutions that conveniently lined up for the new year. so here they are:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;get back into a regular exercise schedule both in and out of the gym.&lt;/i&gt; i completed the process of joining the gym at work at the end of december, so i'm excited to get back into a weight lifting plan. and i know i'd feel great if i were certain to get a good amount of aerobic exercise regularly as well, instead of just sporadically. (if only i had ainsley's &lt;a href="http://www.abslide.com/"&gt;abslide&lt;/a&gt;!)
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;improve my time management skills for both work and personal tasks.&lt;/i&gt; one potential start is by reading david allen's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670899240/ewallorg"&gt;getting things done: the art of stress-free productivity&lt;/a&gt; and seeing if i could really go for his proposed organizational system. (incidentally, this came partially as a mandate from my boss at our half-year review a few weeks ago.)
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;litter my house, car and cubicle with appropriate scripture reminders.&lt;/i&gt; lately i've been collecting some great verses that i'd like to focus on and remember, but i need to transfer them to 3x5 cards and post them around where i'll see and read them. i'm excited about this one, because it's just a good thing all around.
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm going to get back to work now, but in my next installment i promise to tell you about my marvelous holidays in chicago...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vigilantes of love's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1410905"&gt;summershine&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; bill mallonee and company put this one out this past summer (you'd never guess by the name), and it does more or less "shine" with peppy tunes that seem a bit happier than some of their earlier efforts (once again, you'd never guess by the name). this one's new to me, so i'm withholding final judgments until i've gotten to know it better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/8378671'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/8378671'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#8378671' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-8110704</id><published>2001-12-22T00:45:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-12-22T01:07:39.000+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;the best things happen when you're dancing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this should prove to be a pretty amazing holiday season for me. for starters, since my birthday is on christmas eve i'm not used to anybody making a fuss about it (a fact which amuses me to no end). after hearing all my pretend whining saying that "i don't have a birthday," ainsley decided to do something about it: she collected encouraging notes from many of my friends far and near, and added her own thoughtful and cute gifts, into a 24-day "birthday advent" calendar. it has been so fun to open the little packages every day, and some of the letters have made me tear up either because they were so encouraging or so funny. as if that weren't enough, today they had a cake for me at work, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; my parents already got me the superhandydandymultitoolerama, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; ainsley's mom is promising that while i'm out there for my b-day she's going to make sure it's celebrated right, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; zach even considered buying me a &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt; present for my birthday. (maybe i should start hinting that i want a mig24wave laptop antenna for my &lt;a href="http://www.orinocowireless.com/"&gt;orinoco 802.11b wireless card&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.antennasystems.com/broadband.html"&gt;antenna systems&lt;/a&gt;... a computer geek's dream come true!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ainsley's mom is a holidayholic of sorts, and is certain to fill the days with imperative family fun like baking cookies and watching old movies (&lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0047673"&gt;white christmas&lt;/a&gt;, anyone?). and the day after christmas (known as "boxing day" or "st. stephen's day" in some places, why i do not know) ains and i will drive down to indiana to visit with ben &amp;amp; kris, ak, and tyler &amp;amp; elizabeth. (not-so-subtle-hint: i'll know who my &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; friends are if they come!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for some inexplicable reason i'm writing like &lt;a href="http://www.thesimpsons.com/bios/bios_townspeople_ned.html"&gt;ned flanders&lt;/a&gt; today. sorry; i'm seeing my neurologist about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; everything but the girl's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=795107"&gt;temperamental&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; there's nothing temperamental about this album; it's just one smooth groove from beginning to end. not as good as some of their other work, as it's a bit more repetative and a tad less emotive, but good background noise or sit-back-and-watch-the-traffic tunes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/8110704'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/8110704'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#8110704' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-8053944</id><published>2001-12-19T23:26:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-12-19T23:33:18.000+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;don't buy it&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everyone at work is off at a "quarterly communications meeting", about 95% of which is mostly completely useless to me, so i begged out. i'm supposed to be programming a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596000278/ewallorg"&gt;perl&lt;/a&gt; software distribution manager, but instead i'm blogging, for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not usually one to beg, i had made a big deal with my parents in a big joke about wanting that &lt;a href="http://www.gerberblades.com/gerberlegendaryblades.html?8251"&gt;gerber urban legend&lt;/a&gt; as a christmas present, mainly because we were doing a "non-material christmas" this year, so i figured there would be no way they'd do it. but i'd forgotten that i still have a birthday on christmas eve... then this past sunday ains and i went up to my parents' place to "have christmas," since we'll be in chicago over the holidays. sure enough, my parents had taken the all-too-subtle hint and gave me the knife/plier/multi-tool for a birthday present! and it's so cool that i need more excuses to carry it and use it (and show it off). and my parents are so cool, too, that i certainly don't need any more excuses to show them off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the above notwithstanding, if you are a friend who's stressing about what to get me for christmas or birthday or even "atheists give presents day" (trina ;^), never fear: i have a solution for you. usually i keep these "wish list" things to myself, and just buy myself the items when they're on sale, but now perhaps i could make them public in case someone finds them handy (even if they're shopping for someone else who's weird like me, i suppose), so here they are: my &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/taf_gift/ewwallace@yahoo.com
"&gt;cdnow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/1J23A4DUVSOEQ/ref=wl_em_to?add-fav=1"&gt;amazon&lt;/a&gt; wishlists, in their full glory and 24-hour e-tail readiness. okay, enough of the advertisements (please pronounce that in the english manner, like "ad-&lt;b&gt;ver&lt;/b&gt;-tis-ments", not the 'merican way, like "&lt;b&gt;ad&lt;/b&gt;-ver-&lt;b&gt;ties&lt;/b&gt;-ments")... we now bring you back to our regularly scheduled programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the other day ainsley had a comment which really took me by surprise, mainly because there was some truth behind it. here's a replay of the conversation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;eric (distracted):&lt;/i&gt; sorry, i was grinning at the cute kid behind you...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;ains (glancing at the boy):&lt;/i&gt; eric wallace, i do believe you have a biological clock!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;eric (long pause):&lt;/i&gt; um...?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;ains (unphased):&lt;/i&gt; i've seen the way you look at these babies and kids...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;eric (defensively):&lt;/i&gt; but i've always looked at kids that way! i can't help that!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;ains (homing in for the kill):&lt;/i&gt; oh no, it's not just the "kids are cute" look i'm talking about; sometimes you have that look that says: "ooh, a baby! i want one!"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;eric (defeated):&lt;/i&gt; oh... um, maybe so, maybe you're right. but there's no rush, really!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;ains (definitively):&lt;/i&gt; good.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i could go on, but i must get back to work. in january i'll tell you about my new "moonlighting" project i'm all excited about, and hopefully i'll have some more updates "from away" (as the mainers say) in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;america&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;perl&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;if you're j.a.p.l. (just another perl hacker), you might find this &lt;a href="http://www.pair.com/pair/current/insider/1201/damianconway.html"&gt;interview with perl guru damian conway&lt;/a&gt; interesting. (via &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/developers/01/12/12/0518201.shtml"&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/perl&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;news&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;in other news, europe is apparently coming to a boil over the ensuing release of the euro as cold, hard cash. quality news rag &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/"&gt;the sun&lt;/a&gt; has published a &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2001551311,00.html"&gt;comparison&lt;/a&gt; of the new euro coin available on new year's day and the commemorative &lt;a href="http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/"&gt;harry potter&lt;/a&gt; gringott's galleon available in time for christmas. (via &lt;a href="http://www.lightningfield.com/eurotrash/"&gt;eurotrash&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;/news&amp;gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i promise to write more real stuff here soon... i keep intending to post something, but don't make the time in the ridiculously crazy schedule. but i will. really. i mean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; donna summer's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=456372"&gt;christmas spirit&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; a co-worked brought this in and recommended it, so it's on the mp3 share for the month now. no surprise, it's in that "diva vocals over a finely crafted pop orchestra" genre, and as that it's not bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;still, it's certainly more cheery than the &lt;a href="http://www.billandvol.com/"&gt;vigilantes of love&lt;/a&gt; disc that's in my car cd player. here's a great bit of lyrics about the state of our state, with a glimpse of hope at the end (from "who knows when the sunrise will be"):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
you can count on your charm&lt;br&gt;
revel in your wealth&lt;br&gt;
improve your appearance&lt;br&gt;
hope in your health&lt;br&gt;
houses of cards tumble&lt;br&gt; 
and reputations fail&lt;br&gt;
marriages crumble&lt;br&gt;
and interest rates sail&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
and there are no more heroes&lt;br&gt;
and there are no rules of thumb&lt;br&gt;
criminals are pardoned&lt;br&gt;
'cause there's no place to put 'em&lt;br&gt;
and babies are torn&lt;br&gt;
'cause nobody wants them&lt;br&gt; 
and whales canonized&lt;br&gt;
by some government program&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
blind men, sad men&lt;br&gt;
dreamers with wishes&lt;br&gt;
paralytics, lunatics&lt;br&gt;
and the back street fringes&lt;br&gt;
all find a place&lt;br&gt;
in Your home at Your table&lt;br&gt;
You make them well&lt;br&gt;
'cause You're willing and able&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
still in the darkness&lt;br&gt;
there's a candle you will see&lt;br&gt;
who knows when the sunrise will be

&lt;p&gt;this book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0072193840/ewallorg"&gt;hacker's challenge&lt;/a&gt;, looks like the perfect read&amp;#8212;informative and interesting. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com"&gt;amazon&lt;/a&gt; even calls it &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553157248/ewallorg"&gt;encylopedia brown&lt;/a&gt; for network security admins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these headaches are driving me crazy. and when they're not driving me crazy, the drugs are. i'm especially enjoying the &lt;a href="http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/cyclobnz.htm"&gt;cyclobenzaprine&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. flexeril), which i'm trying as a muscle relaxant. on it's own, it's not bad... but combined with pain killers and tiredness or low blood pressure, and i become one loopy boy. oh, and the nice thing about the drug is they don't really know why it works&amp;#8212;they figure that it somehow blocks the messages from the brain to the tense muscles. apparently, it's blocking other messages in my brain, too (for example, "blink").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;still trying to get a good installation of &lt;a href="http://www.debian.org"&gt;debian gnu/linux&lt;/a&gt; on a pc here at work. can't yet get the "r128" driver to work for the &lt;a href="http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/xpert2000_pro/index.html"&gt;ati rage 128 pro&lt;/a&gt;-based video card. time to crank up the search engine and start browsing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apparently, micro$oft is very serious about thier &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/"&gt;new security initiative&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q276/3/04.ASP"&gt;this knowledge base article&lt;/a&gt; proves. no longer will every script kiddie be targeting m$ operating systems, when the average typist requires an hour and a quarter to type in his/her own password! (and to think that back in those insecure days before win2k-sp1 a valid password only needed 17,154 characters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a few minutes with the calculator reveals that if said "average typist" were also an average user who likes to change it back to the same password ("password"), s/he would need nearly 4.5 years in order to cycle through enough changes to allow returning to the old password, assuming no vacations, sleep, or typing mistakes. fortunately, there are at least 1.704875893753623113041262043e+427 possible passwords of that length. (btw, don't try this permutation on your average handheld calculator; this one kept a 1.7ghz pentium 4 thinking for a spell.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i made it into &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/"&gt;the wayback machine&lt;/a&gt;! a 1998 version of my college-years webpage has been archived for future generations at &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990203171402/www.css.tayloru.edu/~ewallace/"&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/19990203171402/www.css.tayloru.edu/~ewallace/&lt;/a&gt;. funny thing is, up until a couple months ago you could've still seen the page, unchanged, at &lt;a href="http://www.css.tayloru.edu/"&gt;taylor's computer science department web server&lt;/a&gt;. i guess they finally got around to losing it (which is too bad, because i'd been trying to see if there were any files there i'd like to keep).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sign watch&amp;#8212;seen recently on a real estate agent's sign in gorham: &lt;i&gt;give thanks to all mankind&lt;/i&gt;. this is an apparent demonstration of the difficulty of figuring out who to thank on thanksgiving day in a post-christian society. do they really mean that they want to thank &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; mankind? even people we don't know from somewhere in &lt;a href="http://allafrica.com/angola/"&gt;angola&lt;/a&gt;, or the members of the beleagured taliban? and what exactly are we thanking them for, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;found on &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/01/11/20/1644248.shtml"&gt;/.&lt;/a&gt; this morning, i now know what i want for christmas. (i guess i'm getting into the christmas spirit after all!) i haven't exactly decided which of the two i'd prefer, but i'd be overjoyed to be the proud owner of either the &lt;a href="http://www.gerberblades.com/gerberlegendaryblades.html?8251"&gt;multi-plier 700 "urban legend"&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://www.gerberblades.com/gerberlegendaryblades.html?8239"&gt;multi-plier 800 "legend"&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.gerberblades.com/"&gt;gerber&lt;/a&gt; (the ones who make knives, not baby food). i'm such a geek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; over the rhine's &lt;a href="http://overtherhine.com/music/recordings/cd02/cd02.html"&gt;patience&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; the first time i saw them live was on this tour. they do suffer a little from the sophomore album problem here, but it's still worthwhile... i guess you could just say that listening to any &lt;a href="http://overtherhine.com"&gt;otr&lt;/a&gt; is it's own reward. i'm desparately wishing i could &lt;a href="http://overtherhine.com/when/tourdates/index.html"&gt;see them this december&lt;/a&gt;, but even if i do make it out to chicago it won't be until christmastime, and it still wouldn't be the annual &lt;a href="http://www.taftevents.com/"&gt;taft theatre&lt;/a&gt; show, either. sniff...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;woah... troy leant me a video tape he had a friend record with &lt;a href="http://www.reverbnet.com/01_10_17/index.html"&gt;bj&amp;ouml;rk and sigur r&amp;oacute;s on h.b.o.'s reverb&lt;/a&gt;. picture this: bj&amp;ouml;rk and her microphone, an oversized lucite custom music box, a harpist with an accordian, a nerd with a &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/"&gt;tibook&lt;/a&gt; and a geek with a deck of cards, and a female choir in lappish costume. (okay, so the lapps are from norway, and these ladies were probably from iceland. forgive me.) and incredible music from the incomparible &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1412382"&gt;vespertine&lt;/a&gt; to the best of &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=321426"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; and a bit from &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=438740"&gt;homogenic&lt;/a&gt;. all i can say is: woah. (and i haven't even listened to the &lt;a href="http://www.sigur-ros.com/"&gt;sigur r&amp;oacute;s&lt;/a&gt; part yet!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in other music news (&lt;i&gt;remember: you heard it here first&lt;/i&gt;): ever since i bought &lt;a href="http://www.alvarezgtr.com/"&gt;my new guitar&lt;/a&gt;, i have spent a great deal of time playing it. i suppose there are several reasons for this: (a) i now live alone, so i know i'm not bothering troy when i play (just the neighbors in my new apartment!), and (b) since i don't have a case for this guitar, it's sitting on a stand right by my bedside, so i can play it even if i only have a couple minutes. anyway, the great advantage of this is that my skill and my creativity have improved by leaps and bounds. i just had the funnest bit of toodling where i really let loose and enjoyed it, and dangit if the neighbors didn't enjoy it too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/7159933'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/7159933'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#7159933' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-6902432</id><published>2001-11-06T07:00:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-11-06T07:00:24.533+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;free&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for all (both) of you readers, sorry for not posting in so long again. when i know i'm particularly busy i try to post from work, but that always ends up taking up more time than i expect it to and then i feel guilty about it. then i remember that i'm a salaried employee&amp;#8212;another term for "indentured servant"&amp;#8212;and there's no relation between the hours i spend at work and the compensation i receive (a model which would be more beneficial to me if there were less work to do). phooey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for the past few days while ainsley was gone i was able to get quite a bit done on the home computers, including some more work on the &lt;a href="http://www.snort.org/"&gt;intrusion detection system&lt;/a&gt; (i'm really liking the &lt;a href="http://aris.securityfocus.com/"&gt;aris&lt;/a&gt; service for incident reporting) and the web application development environment (getting ready for some upcoming ideas, some of which will be implemented right here on this site). but that was just the free time: at work, i've spent most of the last week or so fighting with &lt;a href="http://www.samba.org"&gt;samba&lt;/a&gt;, and my butt is on the line if i don't get it in tip-top shape soon (no worries: i'm still thrilled with the software, i just can't seem to coax it into joining the nt domain). tomorrow, though, i might take a break from it and write a cgi interface to &lt;a href="http://www.qpage.org/"&gt;qpage&lt;/a&gt;, which should prove to be rewarding with that sense of accomplishment when it's done (i've been promising it for months now, but no one was really interested, now suddenly my boss is wondering if i can do it before the weekend).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so now ains is back in town (well, her town, at least) for like a week and a half (&lt;i&gt;and there was much rejoicing&lt;/i&gt;). then she goes away for a couple weeks over the entire turkey day time, during which i am likely to go mad. (however, i set a goal for myself to get the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/traincert/Exams/70-240.asp"&gt;big micro$oft exam&lt;/a&gt; done just after t-day, so at least i'll have plenty to occupy my time.) she and i are looking forward to a visit with my parents in camden this weekend; my mom is bubbling over with excitement and nervousness, too. mom called a couple times this morning for working out schedules and such to go see a play, have dinner with bill and bev, etc. oh, even funnier: the weekend before last when i was up in camden, mom was really fretting about the menu for the upcoming visit, since i now don't eat the red meats and ains is more of a vegetarian; i kept on having to reassure my mom that whatever she came up with would be fine, that she isn't (or we aren't) picky, no worries and all that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i should go to bed... i'm already pretty loopy tonight, and ever since the boss had to speak to me again about showing up at work "within an hour of the normal 8:00", i must must must get up and get to work on time (8:30 is my newly self-imposed, self-regulated time). no more 9:30/10/10:30 stumble into work mornings... maybe i should get donuts for the group on my way in tomorrow. mmm, donuts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another odd patriotic message from a real estate agent's billboard: &lt;i&gt;"god made no substance more resilient than the human spirit"&lt;/i&gt;. perhaps this is why nehemiah said of god:
&lt;blockquote&gt;you warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. they sinned against your ordinances, by which a man will live if he obeys them. stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. &amp;#8212;&lt;a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=NEH+9:28-30&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV&amp;showfn=off"&gt;nehemiah 9:29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last year about this time the president of the maine software and information technology industry association (a.k.a. &lt;a href="http://www.mesda.com/"&gt;mesda&lt;/a&gt;, after the former name "maine software developers association") asked me (through my boss) to be on a panel discussion of computer security for their &lt;a href="http://www.mesda.com/ac2001.aspx"&gt;annual conference&lt;/a&gt;, but it didn't work out. now this year's conference is in a couple of weeks, and no invitation. i admit i'm a bit disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;usually i'm quite fond of my registered copy of &lt;a href="http://www.musicmatch.com"&gt;musicmatch jukebox&lt;/a&gt;, but today when i started to rip a cd to mp3, it automatically updated itself, and now it keeps crashing. and i thought my coworkers would really enjoy these &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=328646"&gt;early hits from the pet shop boys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm so excited... i've got a surprise for troy and dave after we get back from the prison tonight: &lt;a href="http://www.dvdplanet.com/productsummary.asp?productid=19810"&gt;thumbwars on dvd&lt;/a&gt;. i haven't even seen the whole thing yet, but what i've seen was a hoot. heh-heh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; radiohead's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=413006"&gt;ok computer&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;  look, i just do what the computer tells me to do. i learned not to argue with a &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0062622"&gt;hal 9000&lt;/a&gt;. "open the cd-rom tray, hal! open the cd-rom tray!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;have a cigar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the other night i wrote out a nice, long post and due to (l)user error it got deleted, so i got frustrated and gave up. alas, those bits of wisdom may be lost to the ages. but never fear, i've more to say today. so here it is, in list form, some bits are geeky and others not, in no particular order nor importance...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.llbean.com/"&gt;l.l. bean's&lt;/a&gt; is just the bestest store, i tell you. i have way too much clothing and outdoorsy stuff bearing their label&amp;#8212;so much that people "from away" (that is, people who aren't from &lt;a href="http://www.state.me.us/"&gt;maine&lt;/a&gt;) have told me i must be a "preppy" or something because i have so much clothes from what they think of as an expensive mail-order company. but they don't know about the outlet store&amp;#8212;where all damaged or returns go at lowered prices, even on the day after christmas&amp;#8212;or the incredible guarantee policy&amp;#8212;which allowed me to exchange 2-year old jeans for a brand new pair the other night. and plus, they're open 24 hours a day, so i can shop in the middle of the night (when i'm most awake!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;great &lt;a href="http://www.mirc.com/faq6.html#section6-32"&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.mirc.com/"&gt;mirc&lt;/a&gt; faq regarding firewalls: &lt;i&gt;"a firewall is not a feature, it is something you need to solve, something to get around."&lt;/i&gt; security-conscious sysadmins such as myself really love to hear this kind of thing, especially when we're involved with tasks &lt;a href="http://theorygroup.com/Theory/irc.html"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;salman rushdie's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067946333X/ewallorg"&gt;fury&lt;/a&gt; has been a great book so far, not that i expected any different. it reminds me a lot of j.m. coetzee's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140296409/ewallorg"&gt;disgrace&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps because of the similarities of the protagonists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="http://aris.securityfocus.com/"&gt;attack registry and intelligence service&lt;/a&gt; is looking better all the time, and i'd like to help out with my home internal (yipes!) or honeynet (not yet available) log files. however, i suppose i should first figure out if i can have &lt;a href="http://www.snort.org/"&gt;snort&lt;/a&gt; log to both &lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com/"&gt;mysql&lt;/a&gt; and the files, or if i can get &lt;a href="http://aris.securityfocus.com/AboutAris.asp"&gt;aris analyzer&lt;/a&gt; to read straight from the db?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i totally need to learn &lt;a href="http://www.dnaco.net/~ivanjs/binary.html"&gt;how to count in binary on my fingers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;i couldn't even begin to tell you about the events of last week, including a hike up old speck mountain in &lt;a href="http://www.wildernet.com/pages/area.cfm?areaID=MESPGN&amp;cu_id=1"&gt;grafton notch state park&lt;/a&gt; and the ensuing fun of getting ainsley to her &lt;a href="http://www.wildmed.com/course_fact_sheets/wfr_facts.html"&gt;wfr&lt;/a&gt; course at the &lt;a href="http://www.hurricaneisland.org/school/base.html"&gt;outward bound hurricane island schools mountain center&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;did i mention that i've become a &lt;a href="http://www.sushi.to/"&gt;sushi&lt;/a&gt; addict? seriously, some days it's practically all i talk about. (okay, perhaps i'm exaggerating just a bit.) but now i'm making fairly regular trips to &lt;a href="http://www.foodinportland.com/sapporo.html"&gt;sapporo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.foodinportland.com/benkay.html"&gt;benkay&lt;/a&gt;. late friday night lance and i went to "roll &amp;amp; roll sushi" at benkay, had a great chat and &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too much &lt;a href="http://www.learn-sushi.com/"&gt;sushi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the late evening made saturday a bit of a rough day, as we got back to my apartment around 2am, and had to get up at six in order to be ready for men's group at seven. but it was a blast&amp;#8212;we had 11 guys at men's group, and many of us went over to see nathan's &lt;a href="http://www.wcsh6.com/comty/who_care.htm"&gt;six who care&lt;/a&gt; project (built on the super-cool new non-linear editing system) at the &lt;a href="http://www.wcsh6.com/"&gt;channel 6&lt;/a&gt; station where he works. the rest of the day i pretty much laid around the house, working on my &lt;a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/vaio/digitalstudio/index.shtml"&gt;new desktop computer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday ainsley woke me up with a ring of the doorbell&amp;#8212;she'd gotten home a day early and wanted to surprise me with a marvelous little breakfast of fruit salad and cresent rolls. wow... how did i end dating the sweetest girl in the world? we were then able to go to my church together (and she got to meet many of the folks there for the first time), as well as syzygus in the evening. if only we'd have had &lt;a href="http://www.digitalsushi.net/"&gt;sushi&lt;/a&gt; it would've been a perfect day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm finding some amusement in america's new patriotism. the sign in front of a nearby mattress and furniture store says the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;god bless america&lt;br&gt;
one year same as cash&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'd like to propose some alternate possibilities:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;one year same as cash&lt;br&gt;
god bless america&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

or&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;i&gt;one nation under god&lt;br&gt;
one year same as cash&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this morning amidst the usual firefighting at work i escaped for a few minutes to the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/tcevents/itevents/Default.asp"&gt;micro$oft technet quarterly briefing&lt;/a&gt;, where i learned that our friends in redmond have a product which is warmly abbreviated as "&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mom/"&gt;mom&lt;/a&gt;". does that worry you as much as it worries me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;if nothing else&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;once again, i haven't written for a few weeks. it's not that i didn't want to, or that i didn't have anything to say (&lt;i&gt;au contraire, &amp;ccedil;a ce n'est pas de problem!&lt;/i&gt;). and i know you won't take the excuse that "i've been busy"... although if i told you that (a) work has been heart-pounding stressful and (b) ainsley has been in town for two whole weeks, then perhaps you'd understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but really, there's one big reason i haven't written much: the implied peer pressure to write about the world trade center terrorism and the ensuing events. it's not that i don't have a lot to say, it's that i'm not sure how much of it is worth saying, nor how much of it will just cause trouble. for example, i'm apparently one of the small minority with the unpatriotic opinion that the u.s. should not just start bombing afghanistan simply because the country might contain the perpetrator of the crimes against us; moreso, i don't think islam (which, incidentally, is the world's largest religion presently) is our enemy and i don't think we want a "jihad" on our hands. but i'm not going to get into all that. i think it's most important that i deal with my own heart and my own response, in part because i simply can't change anyone else's. enough said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so now where do i begin? should i tell you about how we handled the &lt;a href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.nimda.a@mm.html"&gt;nimda virus&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/bi/asiq"&gt;sybase asiq&lt;/a&gt; upgrade, or the suspicious activity at work? how about the funny things that have happened? or maybe i could tell you how much i've been learning about god lately? or would you rather hear sappy stories about times with ainsley? why am i asking you these questions, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in lieu of content, i'll present some additions to the list of handy french phrases.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;vous l'avez mis &amp;agrave; l'envers, madame.&lt;/i&gt; (lit: "you've put it on backward, ma'am.")
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;ccedil;a t'apprendra &amp;agrave; &amp;ecirc;tre aussi stupide!&lt;/i&gt; (lit: "that'll teach you to be stupid!")
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;je dois vider mon sac.&lt;/i&gt; (lit: "i've got to empty my bag.")
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;ccedil;a me prend la t&amp;ecirc;te!&lt;/i&gt; (lit: "that takes my head!")
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;tu es toujours dans mes jambes!&lt;/i&gt; (lit: "you are always in my legs!")
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;completely random...&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some handy french phrases from my &lt;a href="http://www.fodors.com/language/"&gt;living language&lt;/a&gt; rip-off calendar:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;nous &amp;eacute;tions serr&amp;eacute;s come des sardines.&lt;/i&gt; (lit: "we were packed in like sardines.")
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;il a encore fait des siennes.&lt;/i&gt; (lit: "he's done some of his again.")
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;j'ai un petite trou de m&amp;eacute;moire.&lt;/i&gt; (lit: "i have a little memory hole.")
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night i dreamed that my friend kelly (who's currently finishing graduate work in pharmacology) and myself (whose plans for graduate school have drastically changed recently) both suddenly decided we were going to study physics. yes, physics. nearly everyone was shocked and confused. i understand how this dream might have been inspired by my recent considerations, but why would my subconscious involve kelly in this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;/completely random...&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; lucinda williams' &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1386150"&gt;essence&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; my early evaluation is that this is probably her best album from both the production and song-writing perspectives. (and a much better mix than &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=508586"&gt;car wheels...&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;remind me never to go to a music store with lance again... after yesterday's opening of the new building at &lt;a href="http://rootcellar.org/"&gt;the root cellar&lt;/a&gt;, lance and i headed over to &lt;a href="http://www.daddys.com/"&gt;daddy's junky music&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of "browsing". both of us bought guitars, oddly enought within 46 cents of each other in price. his is a used classical; mine is an acoustic/electric from &lt;a href="http://www.alvarezgtr.com/"&gt;alvarez&lt;/a&gt;. (here's a &lt;a href="http://www.alvarezgtr.com/bigguitarspgs/rd20cbig.html"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt;; it's not much to look at, but the sound is pretty darn good for the price.) don't worry, it's not frivolous spending&amp;#8212;i'd been planning on getting such a guitar anyway, and eyeing (earing?) many of the alvarez'es in the stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and despite the whole buying-a-guitar-when-i-hadn't-exactly-planned-on-it thing, lance and i had a really nice time yesterday afternoon. i was tired and in a lousy mood (for reasons i won't get into here), so i really appreciated the opportunity to just talk about anything and everything, from serious to silly, and i ended up much encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ainsley has left for another four days in the woods again, and i'm downloading leonard cohen songs from &lt;a href="http://www.musiccity.com"&gt;morpheus&lt;/a&gt;. (i don't think there's a connection.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; lucinda williams' &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=508586"&gt;car wheels on a gravel road&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; &lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/"&gt;rs'&lt;/a&gt; allison stewart wrote, "a pretty, if overly homogenous record, &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=508586"&gt;car wheels on a gravel road&lt;/a&gt; suffers from its dogged allegiance to mid-tempo country-pop songs at the exclusion of virtually anything else." yup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;tripping billies&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tonight after setting up my new &lt;a href="http://www2.consumer.philips.com/global/b2c/ce/catalog/product.jhtml?divId=0&amp;groupId=TV&amp;catId=COLORTV&amp;subCatId=19TV&amp;productId=19PS50S_37"&gt;tv&lt;/a&gt; and chunking around on the guitar, i took a nice bike ride around back bay (twice around the bay, in fact). portland, maine, doesn't really have any particularly nice parks, but you can forgive it because (a) it's not a real city and (b) it's maine&amp;#8212;you know, &lt;a href="http://www.mainevacations.com/"&gt;vacationland&lt;/a&gt;. (if you really want a nice city park, stop by &lt;a href="http://www.indygov.org/indyparks/funfinder/indyparks_tour/park_eagle_creek.html"&gt;eagle creek park&lt;/a&gt; on the northwest side of indianapolis &lt;i&gt;[fixed the link thanks to tyler. --ed.]&lt;/i&gt;.) but anyway, back cove is quite pleasant all except when the tide is really low and it stinks. but anyway, it's not even half a mile from my house, and perfect for biking laps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, so i meant to be telling a story here. (i should be studying for my micro$oft &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/exams/examasearch.asp?ExamNumber=70-240&amp;ExamTitle=Microsoft%AE+Windows%AE+2000+Accelerated+Exam+for+MCPs+Certified+on+Microsoft%AE+Windows+NT%AE+4%2E0&amp;PageURL=/TrainingAndServices/content/exams/70-240.txt"&gt;240 exam&lt;/a&gt;, and i'm leaving in 45 minutes, so this blogging is a good waste of time.) so on the way down i pass an ice cream truck stopped at the high school, and enjoy its all-too-familiar melody. and i realize something rather funny&amp;#8212;well, at least i think it's funny: when i think of ice cream trucks, the immediate and unavoidable association is drug dealers. yes, drug dealers. you see, i spent most of my formative years in the lousy little town of sanford/springvale, where for quite some time one of the best "street pharmacists" drove the ice cream truck as his legitimate job and sold other types of "candy" to those who requested it. the funny thing is, when he was finally caught and jailed for it, my reaction (as well as many others' i'm sure) was, "well duh... it's about time." i guess we all just assumed that everyone knew about it, and no one really thought to turn him in. (some neighborhood watch program, eh?) and, to add to the amusement, this dealer did get out of prison after five years or so, and i believe that he did go back to driving the ice cream truck. (i cannot confirm, however, if he still sells other "sweets", as i've happily escaped from that miserable town and rarely return.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you'll never think of that friendly neighborhood ice cream man the same way again...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've been told on occasion that my diction (that means the words i choose to use) and verbosity (that means how i tend to be wordy) can be confusing for those who don't appreciate my vain attempts at &lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=obfuscation"&gt;obfuscation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=adumbration"&gt;adumbration&lt;/a&gt;. alas, there is hope for me yet! now, by the wonders of the modern technology...&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/maggeh/"&gt;mightygirl&lt;/a&gt; on chicago, where i just visited about a week ago: "it's like heaven, except with more tollbooths." remarkably, that's almost exactly what i wasn't thinking. (not that it wasn't a good trip... in fact, it was a stellar trip. but that's beside the point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, ironically enough, i'm now all of the sudden considering graduate work at a school there in that fine city. more on that later, because i'm not really prepared to talk about it yet. (ooh, so secretive!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in unrelated news: i now realize that you haven't lived until you've heard your favorite online dictionary sing the hits of &lt;a href="http://www.dictionaraoke.org/music/None-Aha-TakeOnMe.mp3"&gt;a-ha&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.dictionaraoke.org/music/M-sli(C)k_da_ninjA_-_Britney_Spears_-_Oops_I_Did_It_Again.mp3"&gt;britney spears&lt;/a&gt;. for more, see &lt;a href="http://www.dictionaraoke.org/"&gt;dictionaraoke&lt;/a&gt; (also thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/maggeh/"&gt;mightygirl&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;tender blindspot&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don't plug in any computers for a month, and look what happens: everything goes and changes on me. (kindly disregard the fact that i sit in front of four&amp;#8212;yes, four&amp;#8212;computers every day i'm at work.) i guess i'll never be a really good &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt;, because i spend too much time in the real world, and no time at all catching up on the websites of those "virtual friends". on wednesday i finally got &lt;a href="http://www.rr.com/rros2/home/0,1793,17,00.html"&gt;roadrunner&lt;/a&gt; hooked up at the new flat, and in order to prove that it works i had to get the computer(s) up and running. and now i don't have any excuse for not blogging or reading up on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so the news is that &lt;a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mybrainhurts/"&gt;russ&lt;/a&gt; has got a girlfriend. oh man, is he in trouble... &lt;a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mybrainhurts/2001_08_01_archive.html#5247685"&gt;he tells us&lt;/a&gt; she's "smart and cute and funny"&amp;#8212;okay, that's great, all those nice things you'd want and expect for a guy like russell. but there's one more adjective he uses that suggests so much more: he says she's "godly". uh-oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;russ, please understand that i wish only your best, so i ask you: do you know what you're getting yourself into? a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; woman can make you feel happy and proud and peaceful, but a &lt;i&gt;godly&lt;/i&gt; woman will do so much more: she'll hold you to your best at all times, she'll demand your utmost honesty with her and with yourself, she'll encourage you when you so badly want to be down, and she'll constantly point you back to god when you need direction. it's irritating and awe-inspiring at the same time; it's oh-so-difficult and so simple that you'll laugh. she'll grow in your esteem day by day, and you'll never feel worthy of her; rather you'll thank god every morning and night that he would choose to bless you with personal lessons in humility and grace. you'll learn more by seeing the lord and his world through her eyes than you could from a library of the finest literature and theology. if you commit to do these same things for her, you'll learn to love mercy like never before and love the savior who demonstrated it for you both, and you'll find you love each other all the more after every hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so there, i've said it. let that be a warning or an encouragement to you, russ. i didn't intend to rhapsodize; i guess you could say it's &lt;a href="http://www.ewall.org/weblog/archives/show.php?blog=2001_07_08_index.inc#4496937"&gt;a topic that's been on my mind lately&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;spent some time yesterday fighting with the flight search engines looking for some last-minute tickets for ainsley. now, i used to be a &lt;a href="http://www.travelocity/"&gt;travelocity&lt;/a&gt; devotee (in derence to &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.expedia.com"&gt;expedia&lt;/a&gt;), but in the past two months i've been loving &lt;a href="http://www.orbitz.com"&gt;orbitz&lt;/a&gt;. so today i sent them a suggestion that could change the world of travel reservations as we know it (for the better, course). i'm not sharing my recommendation with travelocity quite yet, because i want to give orbitz a chance first, but i will tell you.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a seasoned budget-conscious traveller and online shopper, I've been very impressed with the Orbitz site since its launch, and I've used it often. Nonetheless, I'd like to make a suggestion that, if you implemented it, would make Orbitz.com the best flight search engine ever. You see, many (if not most) users of the flight search want to try several different options for price comparisons: for example, when I search for flights, I check up to 3 different nearby airports and weigh the price difference against the distance and inconvenience. As it is right now, I create a search from one airport, then hit the "Back" button and change to a different airport to re-run the search, and then the same process again a third time. Furthermore, I'll often weigh the results of modifying departure or return dates by one day in either direction, which means dozens more searches until I've found a price and time that I like. Now if your search engine would allow me to enter, for example, 2 different airports or 2 different return dates, and then do a side-by-side comparison of the results (or even list all the values together, but still sorted by price), I'd be so thrilled that I'd never use another flight reservation system again! I do believe that this option would spare your servers some cycles, as the number of searches would be reduced when people could get all their comparitive data in fewer requests... Of course, then you might have more people using your service, if it's really as useful as I would imagine it. So this would be a mutually beneficial improvement!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;someday travellers everywhere will thank me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/weblog/pics/ifs_award.gif" width="200" height="150" border="0" alt="certificate of appreciation" align="left"&gt;i forgot to mention (until now, that is) the super-spiffy award i got for all my hard efforts on the &lt;a href="http://www.ifsna.com/"&gt;ifs&lt;/a&gt; project. yes, it came in a lightweight plastic frame, and was printed on high-quality paper. this certificate of appreciation is apparently &lt;i&gt;"in recognition of [my] extraordinary contribution to ifs manufacturing system implementation"&lt;/i&gt;. the only redeeming value is that it was hand-signed by &lt;a href="http://www.national.com/company/pressroom/gallery/graphics/full_sized/199_rgb.jpg"&gt;our c.i.o. himself&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps someday i'll become an accomplished forger of signatures (but probably not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in unrelated news, my mom has now proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that i come by my craziness by heredity. this weekend when my parents and i were pop-up camping at &lt;a href="http://www.meadowbrookme.com"&gt;meadowbrook&lt;/a&gt; (not recommended, unless you really love r.v. culture), ainsley visited on friday evening and mom surprised us with an amusing little party. you see, my parents had realized that on august 4, 2001, my mom had been a mother for exactly half of her life (from the other perspective, it means she was precisely twice my age), so she held a "half-life mom" party, complete with &lt;a href="http://www.hotwheels.com/"&gt;hot wheels&lt;/a&gt; paper plates and pointy hats, zucchini-chocolate/raspberry cake, and gifts of squirt guns. we played dominoes and laughed a lot, and it couldn't have been a more fun evening. my parents are such a hoot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;hair&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm wondering about hair salon etiquette... you see, i go to this "walk-ins welcome" kind of chain called &lt;a href="http://www.bostonhair.com/"&gt;boston hair co.&lt;/a&gt; (yes, i know that it sounds like they import hair from boston to use as extensions or wigs, but that's not it at all.) my problem is this: there are some girls there who do a really nice job with my cut (for example, "dawn"), and one in particular that does a lousy job every time (let's call her "bonnie"). yesterday when i walked in, one of the newer girls (who does a fine job) was already occupied, and "bonnie" was the only other person there, and she was free... so obviously "bonnie" was the one to do the cut. (a few minutes later, "dawn" walked in from the back room, where she'd been on her lunch break.) this morning as i looked in the mirror, i realized that once again "bonnie" had made some kind of a horrible mistake, in my bangs (is that the right term? i'm not up on this) in the middle of my forehead. how frustrating!&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so what can i do about it? when you walk in, you fill out the top line of a little form with your name and the receptionist puts you on the waiting list; but on the bottom of the form there's a spot to request a particular stylist... so maybe the next time i go and i see that "bonnie" is there working, do you think it would be rude of me to write "dawn" or another name in the slot? what if "bonnie" is the only one free? why am i still putting quotation marks around the names when, in fact, i haven't actually changed the names to protect the innocent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now, there's one minor thing that i've been doing to help, but i'm not sure how much of a difference it makes. i do tend to be a good tipper (ever since a conversation with a friend of mine who's a waiter), and i tip "dawn" and the other skilled stylists quite nicely; i'm also friendly with them and they remember who i am. on the flip side, "bonnie" has no idea who i am nor has she ever received a good tip from me. perhaps sometimes when there's a toss-up of who will take which walk-in client, "dawn" will win because she knows that i'm one of her regulars. but it doesn't always work. so what else can i do?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/4875307'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/4875307'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#4875307' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-4870436</id><published>2001-08-02T19:41:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2001-08-02T19:41:04.236+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;the following items are completely random. don't even try to look for a connection.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dilbert.com/creators/liberty/index.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is such an odd comic strip. i often wonder if seinfeld making a big deal about being "a show about nothing" had adverse effects on the american entertainment industry. this may be conclusive evidence.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;all of my wordly possessions are now in my new apartments. 99.44% of them are still in boxes.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;bad combination: &lt;a href="http://www.ifsna.com/"&gt;ifs&lt;/a&gt; (a.ka. "the bane of my [work] existence") and &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/ProductInfo/terminal/default.asp"&gt;tse&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. "the bane of [my co-worker] aaron's existence"). bad dog! stay away!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;tonight i'm introducing my friend kirsta to &lt;a href="http://www.foodinportland.com/grannys.html"&gt;granny's burritos&lt;/a&gt;, and we should have a nice catching-up session (she's engaged now&amp;mdash;oh my!). and then, wonder of wonders, ainsley is back in town &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; she has the night off, so i'll get to see her! (you simply can't understand how happy that makes me.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the preliminary results from my annual emergency response team comprehensive physical: i'm pretty likely to live another year. i guess that's good news, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when i write that it's a "comprehensive" physical, here's what that entails:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the usual height/weight/ears/eyes/lungs (i have all of those)
&lt;li&gt;reflexes (all too keen, especially the "tickle" one)
&lt;li&gt;4 pages of questions about my respiratory and cardiovascular health (in lieu of the "blow as hard as you can into this machine" test i took last year)
&lt;li&gt;blood test (yes, i have blood)
&lt;li&gt;urine sample (why would they want that?)
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;perhaps i forgot to tell the nurse that i'm wearing out my back with all this moving. finally this evening we'll close on the old apartment and i can go home to my new one and start working there... ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh yeah, that and i'm terribly Distracted. (yes, capital D.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/4833946'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/4833946'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#4833946' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-4766431</id><published>2001-07-27T23:07:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2001-07-27T23:07:53.033+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what a week... tuesday troy, maegan and i all had the day off, so we moved almost everything from her place (soon to be mine). troy and i have been up late packing every other night this week, and i'm still not sure how ready we are. either way, assuming that they start answering the phone over at the local &lt;a href="http://www.uhaul.com"&gt;u-hual&lt;/a&gt; place, we'll have a truck and a handful of friends helping us move the big and heavy stuff into our respective places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this morning i had to have my car washed on the way to work, as it was still caked in mud from the weekend's fun, and the &lt;a href="http://www.statefarm.com/"&gt;state farm&lt;/a&gt;-appointed appraiser was coming to visit to estimate the damage from when my friend backed into the rear-passenger door. he did successfully find me (eventually), and so sometime next week i'll bring zooey (the car) into a place called "bothel's autobody" (not to be confused with "brothels auto body", as &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bothel's+auto+body&amp;lc=www"&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; suggested!). also over lunch i managed to meet up with my new landlord and sign the lease for the new apartment, so i'm all set for the move tonight, i think. oh yeah, and the work day has been constantly interrupted by evacuation drills; since i'm on the emergency response team, we have to do building sweeps after the alarms go off. sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the cardigans' &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=454906"&gt;first band on the moon&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; troy and i made a late-night trip to bull moose records last night to try to sell off some junk albums; he was much more successful than i was ($35 versus $5). but i picked up this disc cheap, and i can't complain (well, i could, but it wouldn't do any good...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;that means a lot&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wow... this weekend was quite a doozy. another 400 miles and a lot of mud on the car. i totally enjoyed camping out alone and waking up to a swim in flagstaff lake. joshua, ainsley and i had a beautiful time of prayer and singing on saturday night. on sunday ainsley and i took an amusing little hike and "had church" on our own (&lt;a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Psalm+104&amp;version=NLT&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref=yes&amp;language=english"&gt;psalm 104&lt;/a&gt;, highly recommended). in the evening i rushed home in time to be late for syzygus, where i announced the plans for taking off the month of august and the changes ahead (new format, leaders, etc.), to very little protest. i ended the evening with a nice chat with lance over at &lt;a href="http://www.greatlostbear.com"&gt;the great lost bear&lt;/a&gt; (talking about&amp;#8212;oh boy&amp;#8212;courting, relationships, women, etc.) and crashed as soon as i got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this morning i turned off the alarm (actually, i used the pager's alarm function, as i'm in the habit of doing) at 6:30 when it so rudely awoke me, and figured i'd go back to sleep for just a few minutes, maybe until 7:15 or so. usually i can do that without much trouble. this morning, however, i finally decided to roll over and look at the clock at what i thought was around quarter to eight, but turned out to be quarter to ten! thankfully, my boss and job hours are flexible...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;troy &amp;amp; maegan (newly married, fresh from the honeymoon) arrive today, and we start and intense week of moving and cleaning. fortunately, maegan already got a head start on packing (whereas troy and i haven't a bit), and lots of friends have volunteered trucks and hands, so hopefully it'll happen smoothly. (oh, the optimism!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the beatles' &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=327402"&gt;anthology 2&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; whatever possessed them to record those lousy new songs for the anthology show? (other than money, of course...) anyway, sometimes you just need to get back to the basics. so i did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today i've had a lot of fun reading all the posts from &lt;a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/frames/?content=/forums/bugtraq/faq.html"&gt;bugtraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ntbugtraq.com/"&gt;ntbugtraq&lt;/a&gt; regarding the &lt;a href="http://www.net-security.org/text/articles/coverage/code-red/"&gt;code red worm&lt;/a&gt; which is affecting &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/iis/"&gt;micro$oft internet intrusion servers (iis)&lt;/a&gt; all over the 'net. by far the best commentary was from today's newsletter from &lt;a href="http://www.apacheweek.com/"&gt;apacheweek&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;if you are running &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/"&gt;apache&lt;/a&gt; there is nothing to worry about, these requests are part of the code red worm virus designed to search out vulnerable iis servers running on windows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
however if you'd like to become vulnerable to attacks such as this, microsoft have a toolkit that will let to migrate from apache to iis. (allegedly the last step is append the text "3L33T crew ownz you" to the bottom of all your web pages to save the crackers some time).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, i'm really going home now. i still haven't gotten in touch with the applebys, so i might not be "clam festing" tonight. darn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for some strange reason, i like to sing the french national anthem when i've had some success with some odd job. so, in celebration of today's installation of the second cluster of &lt;a href="http://www.businessobjects.com/products/webi/"&gt;business objects' webintelligence&lt;/a&gt; (a misnomer, if you ask me) and the rest of this workweek's accomplishments (including a new &lt;a href="http://www.lotus.com/home.nsf/welcome/domino"&gt;lotus notes/domino&lt;/a&gt; database), let's sing:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
allons enfants de la patrie&lt;br&gt;
le jour de gloire est arriv&amp;eacute;!&lt;br&gt;
contre nous de la tyrannie&lt;br&gt;
l'&amp;eacute;tendard sanglant est lev&amp;eacute;...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tonight i may be heading to the &lt;a href="http://www.yarmouthmaine.org/clam.htm"&gt;yarmouth clam festival&lt;/a&gt;, where supposedly there's a parade to kick off the event. (i wonder if they make the clams march, too?) i've got to be home by nine, because the other syzygus leaders (with the exception of troy, who's still off in honeymoon bliss and is not to be disturbed) will be dropping by my house for our weekly chat/planning/prayer/etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tomorrow i'm off to &lt;a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?BFCat=&amp;Pyt=Tmap&amp;newFL=Use+Address+Below&amp;addr=&amp;csz=eustis%2C+me&amp;country=us&amp;Get%A0Map=Get+Map"&gt;eustis, maine&lt;/a&gt; (motto: "get useless in eustis"), conveniently located near nothing at all. well, that's nothing except for &lt;a href="http://www.hyde.edu/"&gt;hyde's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.hyde.edu/docs/wilderness/index.asp"&gt;lennox k. black wilderness preserve&lt;/a&gt;, where my sweetie is working at the moment. (yes, i know i just used the word "sweetie". sorry.) joshua and i will get a chance to visit with her tomorrow night, then i get to camp out all by my lonely somewhere out there in the &lt;a href="http://www.hyde.edu/images/wilderness/map_1.jpg"&gt;bigelow preserve&lt;/a&gt; (i hope the quiet doesn't keep me awake), and then i'll get to visit with ainsley some more on sunday before i head back home in time for syzygus (which is, once again, at my house, so i'd better be on time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i've been avoiding work long enough. i was supposed to have a meeting with my boss fifteen minutes ago, but i can hear over the wall that he's still in a meeting with someone else. either way, i should get back to work, cleanup, and get out of here. hope your weekend is as fun as mine is going to be!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/4643143'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/4643143'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#4643143' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-4496937</id><published>2001-07-12T08:09:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2001-07-12T08:09:55.926+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, i'll confess: i haven't been completely honest with you. you see, i haven't really told you everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please understand: anyone with access to the world wide web can read my musings in this online journal. some of you readers are, in fact, people in whom i confide much more than will ever be written here, and that's great&amp;mdash;i'm impressed that you find me interesting enough to want to know even more. other readers i don't know so well: perhaps there are things that i don't want to share with all of you; no doubt there are things you don't share with me, and that's all right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so now i have some news which any and all of you may read. i didn't really tell you anything about it as the situation was progressing throughout the past few months. i couldn't tell you about it a month ago, because i didn't want certain friends to discover the news in such an impersonal way, but i've since been able to talk with them in person. so now it's out, and i don't care who knows. heck, i want everyone to know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am dating the most incredible young woman i have ever met. her name in ainsley&amp;mdash;perhaps you've met her? you'd remember if you had. she loves people so much, and makes you feel like you're the most important person in the world, even if you just happen to be running her groceries through the scanner at the checkout&amp;mdash;that's just the kind of person she is. and so much more importantly, she loves god with all of her heart, and she's not afraid to tell you that's the reason for the joy she has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so you think i'm biased? perhaps... but perhaps you haven't met her. am i overly emotional? not at all. i assure you i'm quite cool-headed about this whole thing, and no decision has been made without prayer support. am i continually surprised at what god is doing in my life? you betcha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that's enough of my babbling for tonight. now you've had an introduction; more will follow soon. thanks for tuning in, and keep coming back&amp;mdash;the story only gets better from here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/4496937'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/4496937'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#4496937' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-4033744</id><published>2001-06-12T17:43:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2001-06-12T17:43:29.513+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;family snapshot&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here's a few vivid word pictures from the past few days of my life...&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;sunday afternoon, 4:46 p.m.&lt;/i&gt; a half dozen guys armed with brushes and rollers, silhouetted against a freshly-painted sunny yellow wall in ainsley's new apartment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;sunday night, 1:02 a.m.&lt;/i&gt; eric, worn to a frazzle, crawling up his own back stairway after finally leaving denny's and saying goodbye to all the syzygus folks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;sunday night, 1:08 a.m.&lt;/i&gt; eric without his glasses or contacts, squinting in the mirror after just flinging a blob of toothpaste into his own eye from the bristles of his toothbrush.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;monday night, 11:23 p.m.&lt;/i&gt; keith, water dripping from his glasses, hair and beard; and eric, soaked through from ball cap to jeans, walking through downtown portland in the rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;tuesday morning, 8:03 a.m.&lt;/i&gt; eric's hair after tossing and turning in bed for most of the early morning hours, worrying about an imaginary project at work.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;one more cup of coffee&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;talk about "burning the candle at both ends"... i'm basically throwing the candle into the over during the cleaning cycle! my burn rate is incredible right now: i have essentially every minute of this weekend planned out already, and not a moment to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to add to the fun this week, i got an offer to take another &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/default.asp?PageID=mcp&amp;SubSite=examinfo/policies&amp;PageCall=betaexam"&gt;microsoft beta exam&lt;/a&gt;. so yesterday afternoon i spent roughly two and a half hours &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/exams/examasearch.asp?ExamNumber=70-226&amp;ExamTitle=Designing+Highly+Available+Web+Solutions+with+Microsoft%AE+Windows%AE+2000+Server+Technologies&amp;PageURL=/TrainingAndServices/content/exams/70-226.txt"&gt;designing highly available web solutions with microsoft windows 2000 server technologies&lt;/a&gt;. i have no idea how well i did; if i passed, it would be an amazing demonstration of my skill in b.s. (after all, i do have a b.s. in english education!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i suppose i should try to get some work done today, eh? it's already 11am...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; bob dylan's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=317238"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; i'd have to say that musically, bobby's work in the mid-70's was the best of his career; although he's always had the knack for the lyrics (think of 1966's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=316976"&gt;blonde on blonde&lt;/a&gt;). when i found that this album closely followed  &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=317208"&gt;blood on the tracks&lt;/a&gt; (undoubtably his best), i had to pick it up, and i'm so glad i did. the recording quality is a little weak; perhaps it was lousy digital remastering for the cd release. but the music is great, from the lively "hurricane" to the hollow booming drums of "joey" to the jangling "oh, sister". and throughout the disc your ears are soothed by the sweet voice of emmylou harris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;the rub of love&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this whole syzygus idea is a grand experiment. the word "syzygus" (if you haven't heard) is greek for "yokefellows", which is english for "people who pull together and bear each others' burdens". i say it's an experiment because most of us, being fairly young, haven't seen many examples or real love in action (sadly enough, few churches demonstrate this in any meaningful way). when i say "real love" here i don't mean the late beatles song, and i don't mean the whole man-woman luv thang: i mean the kind of self-sacrificing, all-important love that jesus showed us. syzygus is an experiment because we're actually trying to live out this kind of love: when someone is in need, we respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of course, this hasn't always been the case. for nearly three years we've been growing together, but i wouldn't say we've been bearing each others' burdens too well; but now it seems we're learning how to serve, and it really is a joy. and now we're even beginning to make a habit of it, and i do hope it continues. it's amazing to hear a need and see that people are already, seemingly automatically, responding... for example, nathan has become the "car man"&amp;mdash;when anyone in the group speaks of car troubles, nathan is soon under the hood and gathering others to help him troubleshoot and fix. love should be so natural, so commonplace, so free...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; this love is also hard to figure out. god seems to have a handle on how love should work, but humans are so far from it at the start. the idea of self-sacrifice certainly doesn't come natural, and the commitment must be remade again and again. and then so often we know that something must be done, but we don't know how to do it. such was the situation tonight, as one of our number needs some help, and we are at a loss as to how to best help her, but we're trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if perchance some sunday evening you're driving by a &lt;a href="http://www.dennys.com/"&gt;denny's&lt;/a&gt; in portland and you see a rowdy bunch of twenty-somethings standing around in the parking lot alternately laughing, crying, hugging or dancing, there's no need to worry: they're just trying to figure out what it means to love as god does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; over the rhine's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=767137"&gt;amateur shortwave radio&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; live and unforgettable, it spans ten years of o.t.r.'s music, including the obligatory "my love is a fever"... because it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apparently, this is "picture week" here on my little corner of the web, so to continue with the theme i've included another picture in today's posting...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/weblog/pics/managing.jpg" alt="managing multiple projects, objectives and deadlines" wdith="250" height="136" border="0" align="right"&gt;i was amused to find this ad in my junk mail at work the other day. they suggest that i can "learn how to get and keep control of concurrent projects, competing priorities and critical deadlines" for a mere $199. gee, if they had only got to me a few weeks earlier, i might have been spared the current melodrama. my boss' boss (the department head) found out about my little confidential chat with a trusted h.r. representative last friday (oddly enough, he heard it from said h.r. staffer), so tomorrow i'm due for a chat with the big guy at 10:15. i'm looking forward to it with eager trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i finished the first &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/059035342X/ewallorg"&gt;harry potter book&lt;/a&gt; over a long lunch parked down by the airport runways. later in the evening at the bookstore i struggled to keep myself from buying &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439064872/ewallorg"&gt;the second one&lt;/a&gt;, resolving that i must either see if ainsley has it (when i return this one to her) or get a library card (what a novel idea!). now i'm torn over what i should read as i try to go to sleep tonight... perhaps i should start a quick re-read of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553280414/ewallorg"&gt;a separate peace&lt;/a&gt;, or finish up &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375725784/ewallorg"&gt;a heartbreaking work of staggering genius&lt;/a&gt; (which, now that i'm bogged down in the middle of it, seems more staggering for its diarrhea-of-the-mouth than for its "genius")? or maybe i should just try to go to sleep like a normal person would...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the police's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=320657"&gt;message in a box, disc 4&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;i can't, i can't, i can't stop singing it; i can't, i can't, i can't stop singing it; can't stop signing it!&lt;/i&gt; (lately singing "murder by numbers" loudly over my cubicle walls has helped keep my co-workers at a safe distance.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/weblog/pics/epriest.jpg" alt="a portrait of the artist as a young priest" width="150" height="219" border="0" align="left"&gt;troy has recently been inspired by a silly little program (whose name i forget) which helps you apply faces of you and your friends onto the bodies from other pictures. it makes short work of the transfiguration, including the resizing and color balance, and afterwards the results usually need some touchup in &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/"&gt;photoshop&lt;/a&gt; (no problem). the picture you see here is our most inspired and laborious effort so far. the priest is from the mysterious pair of priestly pictures on our mantle; the other member of the pair will be transplanted with troy's face soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hitchcock's &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Details?0047396"&gt;rear window&lt;/a&gt; is playing on the tele at the moment, and i'm intriqued as i've not seen it before. but i'll have to keep it in mind next time i need a rental, as sometime soon this evening joshua will stop by. we're due for "the last coffee", as it were, before he leaves for a short-term mission trip to kenya. for the past few weeks he's been saying he won't be coming back. (idle threats, i think, but no doubt it's tempting!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;i could've danced all night&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/weblog/pics/dawndance.gif" alt="dawn dance nametag" width="200" height="128" border="0" align="right"&gt;ow. my body hurts. last night half a dozen of us drove the three-and-a-half hours to brattleboro, vermont, for the memorial day dawn dance. it's a contradance that runs all night&amp;mdash;through dawn, as the name might suggest&amp;mdash;and it is a blast. i think i must be getting old, as i shouldn't be so worn out by a mere seven hours in the car, seven hours dancing like a lunatic, and thirty hours without a wink of sleep&amp;mdash;but i am. but dang, it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stats.distributed.net/rc5-64/psummary.php3?id=353405"&gt;my cows&lt;/a&gt; are doing well, too. thursday i set up some of my computers with the &lt;a href="http://www.distributed.net/"&gt;distributed.net&lt;/a&gt; client, and they've been chunking away at the bits ever since.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/3838360'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/3838360'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#3838360' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-3811219</id><published>2001-05-27T07:10:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2001-05-27T07:10:38.706+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;faithfully dangerous&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wacko. kooky. downright weird. i'm glad that i at least find my life amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'll try not to complain about work much here. when people have asked me how i'm doing, the best answer i could muster was "surly." this seeming non-sequitur usually confuses the listener (not unlike deer in the headlights) and prevents further inquisition. suffice it to say that i've been collecting "cold pricklies" this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thursday night a few of us had a surprise dessert shin-dig for dave's 30th birthday, and i was glad i could get out of work in time. however, i desserted them fairly quickly, because my favoritest band in the whole wide world, &lt;a href="http://www.overtherhine.com/"&gt;over the rhine&lt;/a&gt;, was here in portland: a rare blessing indeed. the show was scheduled at the last minute at this new little chem-free hangout called "the well" (which was apparently put together by some local &lt;a href="http://www.salvationarmy.org/"&gt;salvation army&lt;/a&gt; folks, and perhaps a couple of people from my church, i think). it was a blast to hear the band having fun&amp;mdash;the road drummer (dale?) was grooving; jack has finally fit his guitar style into the band; "sassy keys" linford was, well, sassy; and karen really got into it, especially towards the end. the last time o.t.r. was in portland they opened for &lt;a href="http://www.cowboyjunkies.com/"&gt;the cowboy junkies&lt;/a&gt;, and the audience seemed to really want to get on with the headline act, so o.t.r.'s set was slim and trim. but this little show, with perhaps only 50 or so there, was a lot of fun. (sorry, dave!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a bump of the fast-forward button brings us to this evening (don't worry, all that you missed was a whole bunch of work, both in the office and at home, and a fun breakfast with joshua's family), which i'm still chuckling about. (of course, i'm only chuckling quietly to myself, so as not to worry those around me.) pastor mutima (from the international church) is, as ainsley says, "the sneakiest volunteer coordinator in the world", and thusly last sunday he told us that he was "forming a committee" and that we were "already on it". later that day claude told me that the committiee is to help plan for a wedding. so, that's what we did... we began planning for a wedding (about six weeks away!) for a dear young lady named fran&amp;ccedil;oise and her fianc&amp;eactue; d&amp;eactue;sir&amp;eactue;, who's just recently come down from canada. not being african myself (you might have guessed from the pictures), these came as a bit of shock to me: the spirit of togetherness and the idea that everyone in the committee being in agreement as more important the the bride and bridegroom's wishes. and at the end of the discussion, d&amp;eactue;sir&amp;eactue;'s prayer was uplifting, as he made plain his sincere desire to live for chirst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so i ask myself: how do i get into these things? why does god spend so much time humoring me? i'm still tripping over the idea that i just met d&amp;eactue;sir&amp;eactue; and i'm already helping to plan his wedding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fascinating, and downright mystifying: apparently, "kaycee" was some woman's imaginary daughter. here's a &lt;a href="http://rootnode.org/article.php?sid=26"&gt;faq&lt;/a&gt;, and a more &lt;a href="http://www.vanderwoning.com/mess.shtml"&gt;personal account from randall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please ignore my comments in that previous post about her; since i don't work for &lt;a href="http://home.sprintmail.com/~astronomer/documents/minitrue.htm"&gt;minitrue&lt;/a&gt; i won't play the revisionist-history game. i'm embarrassed to say that i was fooled as well, but i was certainly not alone. this causes me to wonder:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perhaps the fact that i don't spend a lot of time keeping up with the "blog community" is a good thing&amp;mdash;i do have a real life, even if my job is trying to suck the life-blood from my veins
&lt;li&gt;we ought to remember that information provided on the internet has no guarantee of truth&amp;mdash;but then again, how often have you read the little blob of "corrections" of the previous day's lies and misinformants in your local newspaper?

&lt;p&gt;you know, these cubicle parts are stronger than you might expect... a couple hours ago, in a moment of poor anger management, i nearly kicked the crap out of one of the metal drawers in my cube. fortunately, almost no one was around, so i didn't have to explain the noise to anyone. but now my ankle is obviously in more pain than the drawer, and i'm beginning to wonder the value of redirecting one's frustration towards inanimate objects rather than the (somewhat softer) person (or persons) who is the cause of the rath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;since i gave up hope&lt;br&gt;(i feel a lot better)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last week of the fiscal year '01 at work, and boy are we in for it. my goals this week include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;build a crappy &lt;a href="http://www.dell.com/"&gt;dell&lt;/a&gt; server with even crappier software from &lt;a href="http://www.businessobjects.com/"&gt;business objects&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make a quick &lt;a href="http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/"&gt;dns&lt;/a&gt; replica in order to approximate a goal for high-availability
&lt;li&gt;proving to &lt;a href="http://www.silverstream.com/"&gt;silverstream&lt;/a&gt; that their implementation of &lt;a href="http://www.openldap.org/"&gt;ldap&lt;/a&gt; is foobar, and then perhaps beat them with log files of the ridiculously heavy transactions the software requests
&lt;li&gt;discover the mastermind behind &lt;a href="http://www.ifsworld.com/united_states/"&gt;ifs&lt;/a&gt;, which is obviously not a software product but a plan for usurpation of businesses worldwide
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as you can guess, it will be a full (but fun) week. and for some odd reason, i'm as happy as &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679720200/ewallorg"&gt;meursault&lt;/a&gt; with those &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=331799"&gt;existential blues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;to the teeth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i made it back to work today, although i'm not sure if i'm ever going back again, at least not without be armed and stoned (or "loaded and loaded", if you'll allow me to coin a phrase). i wanted to go for only half a day today, seeing that i still feel like poop and all. (at least now i feel like poop in a sewage treatment plant, thanks to the wonders of antibiotics. which reminds me, i need to go take some now...) alas, before i even arrived i was already being paged regarding the day's fires. one fire in particular took almost the entire day, and had me on the phone again and again saying, "oh no wait, it's not working... let me call you back," then again, "okay, please try it and let me know," and cycling again. as the afternoon wore on, i began coughing up bronchi in huge chunks and promising that i would leave soon, but the people on the other end of the phone kept saying, "oh please wait until we've tested it before you go." when i finally left at five, i had to sneak out, because i was technically still supposed to be waiting for that phone call. (when i checked my voice mail seven hours later, there was still no message stating that i could go home. something tells me that they're not still working at this hour of the night.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i then arrived home in a horrible mood&amp;mdash;i'm sure my roommate could attest to that&amp;mdash;and began working on my paper, which was due as some indeterminate hour this evening (according to my professor, who's still grading papers now at midnight, "before i leave the office"). i worked right through the time when i should've been at &lt;a href="http://www.mywebhome.com/yokefellow/html/prison.htm"&gt;yokes&lt;/a&gt; (i've only been once out of the last six weeks!) and then through a near-final episode of &lt;a href="http://www.startrek.com/"&gt;voyager&lt;/a&gt;. thankfully, they shared the pizza with me, even brought a plate out to the kitchen for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at long last, i finished up my paper around 10:15, and now i have way too much adrenaline to deal with. perhaps i'll lift weights for a few minutes before settling down tonight&amp;mdash;anything to get rid of some energy. i still have to sleep in a sitting-up position, which is getting rather uncomfortable now after four nights, even in the comfy chair which i discovered at 5am yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;okay, before i sign off: some bad news, then some really good news. first the bad: as you may have heard if you frequent blog circles (which i don't, really, but...), &lt;a href="http://vanderwoning.com/living/blog.shtml"&gt;kaycee&lt;/a&gt; died this past monday, after a fairly lengthy fight with leukemia. she was 19. i've been catching up on her blogs, and am only now realizing what a sweetheart she was. i'm looking forward to meeting her in heaven someday.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now for the really, really good news: brasier's mom finally got her lung transplant, and the operation and recovery has been amazing. she'd been waiting for a fitting doner for four years now, each day finding it harder to breathe on her own due to an inherited degenerative lung disease. monday evening a 20-year old girl lost her life in a tragic car accident, but she gave a small part of her life to eric's mom. the doctor had performed over 300 transplants and said that eric's mom was one of the top five for how quickly she was recovering&amp;mdash;only half an hour after the surgery was done, she was already awake and breathing with the new lung!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know, despite how much i complain and whine here about the stresses of my life and the pain around me, it's just a reminder that
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the spirit, groam inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. for in this hope we were saved. but hope that is seen is no hope at all. who hopes for what he already has? but if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="right"&gt;romans 8:22-25, niv&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;eric's mom has had a taste of the redemption and resurrection of her body, after waiting patiently for so long. but how much better will her full resurrection be? &lt;strike&gt;and kaycee had been expecting and awaiting her homegoing, a bit uncertain, but hopeful. and i'm certain that this hope did not disappoint either of them.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ani difranco's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=800881"&gt;to the teeth&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; there's a line which ani repeats repeatedly in the song "freakshow" that states: "there's a lotta love in compliance". a thought-provoking statement, no doubt. so i thoughtfully ponder this line, and wonder to myself about all the things i "comply" with, thereby demonstrating my love for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;leave me now&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt;'s back up, and so am i, more or less... and i'm actually taking the time to post! it's like a new, easy-going, laissez-faire eric!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so here's the scoop: you might remember that i was supposed to have my teeth ripped out this morning. if you remembered that, then you probably remember that i have been feeling sick the past couple of days. can you guess which of these two situations won?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;saturday was crazy, from men's group to troy &amp;amp; maegan's graduation to helping dave &amp;amp; kim drop off a desk for the &lt;a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/"&gt;sierra club&lt;/a&gt; (tree huggers!) to finally making it to my parents' place in camden and crashing into bed. sunday was the exact opposite: i laid in bed, followed by some more laying in bed, and then i was in bed some more. you see, what i had thought was just a nice, pleasant 24-hour flu and perhaps a pollen reaction was really an infection that one might call "strep throat".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;needless to say, i didn't make it to the oral surgeon's this morning, and they won't take my teeth until july 2nd now (dang!). i did, however, manage to visit a gp (or, specifically, one in training, who was labelled a "p.a or physician's assistant) and get a prescription for amoxicillin, which is making me almost as happy as the pain killers would have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;had a small tiff with troy this evening, as there was some confusion about who was covering syzygus last night, which meant that no one did. rumor is that they had a meeting over in the elementary school parking lot without us (and our apartment), and i'm proud of them. joshua apparently handled the police visit well... from my prespective, you see, i had made phone calls to both troy and maegan, trying to see where they were. they were supposed to be in camden, but the rumor was that troy had taken maegan to the e.r. with a high fever on saturday night, and they supposedly weren't in church on sunday, as they had planned. only this morning did my dad suddenly remember that troy was in camden yesterday, and therefore was apparently not home in time for syzygus. alas, it was realized too late for any of us to do anything about it. i'm sure i'm going to get some flack for it this week... but, you know, since i'm still contagious and all, i bet they'd thank me if they knew i had spared them this infection for only a minor inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i wonder if i'll actually sleep if i go to bed now. i've had to try to sleep in a sort of sitting-up position the past two nights (due to lung drainage and all those things you don't want to think of when you're not sick), and it's not the most comfortable, especially since i normally sleep most of the night on my side. at least i don't have to go back to work until wednesday, and even then it will be a short week, as i still plan to visit the &lt;a href="http://www.hyde.edu/"&gt;hyde school&lt;/a&gt; on friday. well, anyway... goodnight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;i tried to post this last night, but &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt; was sick too. so now for your reading pleasure:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm supposed to be doing homework now, seeing that most of it is due on
saturday, and the paper is due next week. but i've done all the homework i
can do tonight, which i'll admit is not much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in lieu of doing homework, i'm supposed to be sending out a couple of
emails tonight, with subjects ranging from
"hate-to-have-to-be-serious,-but..." to "good-to-hear-from-you!" to "ASAP".
i am not doing any of those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what i am doing is going to bed. i'm sick, and i can't afford to be sick
right now. i can't afford to be unproductive or missing from work. i can't
afford to miss my tooth extraction on monday. i can't afford to jeopardize
my edge-teetering sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;turns out i had one of those 24-hour flu things. before bed i was shivering madly, then i slept feverishly hot, and dreamt about some evil organization that was pretending to help the poor but was really harming them. daylight was a welcome sight, and now i'm feeling much better. too bad i'm going to miss out on contradancing tonight.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this week is going downhill fast. work has just been the worst place to be recently, and if you know me you know how i obsess about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;monday a guy in the cal-lab toasted the pc that controls all his electronic calibration tools, and i don't know what i can do for him. yesterday (tuesday) they announced that due to the "slowdown" and "poor projections for the next quarter," we get another 7 unpaid days off from work this summer, and they're laying off 10% of the workforce worldwide (fortunately only about 5% of our site, however). they gave us the night to think it over, and today we got the news as to who it is...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;no surprise, out of the 4 groups in the i.s. department, it was the desktop support group that took the hit. effectively immediately the other greg (a.k.a. "zeek") is gone. ouch. he's taking it well, and it may just turn out to be a good thing for him (he hated the half-time helpdesk responsibilities), but nonetheless: ouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just after finding out about greg, i get a phone call from my close friend dave, who is in the cafeteria looking over his severence package. ouch! he wasn't particularly surprised, but obviously he's not particularly happy either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as for me, that now leaves me with two jobs and (soon) two trainees that will come down from another area, all while getting the same pay ("no merit increases") and all the old crap that i thought i'd left behind in the support group, and no more lunches with dave to complain about it all. i lack the vocabulary to explain how much this sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=376972"&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0117509"&gt;romeo + juliet&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; as shakespeare modernizations go, this is one excellent film. (nevermind leonardo's acting; he's the perfect fool that willy wanted for romeo.) part of the reason for the movie's success is the stunning combination of visual art and music. this soundtrack is just a hint&amp;mdash;and not what you'd expect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/3565667'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/3565667'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#3565667' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-3499489</id><published>2001-05-05T02:29:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2001-05-05T02:31:53.736+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;all my tears (be washed away)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a short list of what's been happening with me since i last posted here:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;greg's funeral.&lt;/i&gt; this was my first time in the stunningly beautiful (you might even say "immaculate") &lt;a href="http://www.portlandlandmarks.org/churches_walking_tour_images/immaculate_conception.JPG"&gt;cathedral of the immaculate conception&lt;/a&gt;, which had apparently recently been remade on the inside to be surprisingly light and cheery. the funeral and burial were understandably difficult, but it was a joy to see so many people who had been touched by greg's honest love for others.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;the wedding of d&amp;egrave;ja-vu.&lt;/i&gt; this was my second time in the cathedral, on the day immediately after the first. it was unnerving to have to go through the same mass with the same priest in the same church while trying not to think about the previous day's service, especially since i knew a grand total of one other person at the wedding (the friend who invited me). further d&amp;egrave;ja-vu ensued when i began thinking that i recognized just about everyone there, but couldn't place why. of course i didn't know any of them, but my mind was playing some strange trick on me.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;work is hell.&lt;/i&gt; suddenly, i understand why matt groening wrote &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394748646/ewallorg"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; in his earlier days. two guys in my department took it upon themselves to ruin their pc's this week, when they knew that we don't have anyone who can fix them since greg is gone. guess who's been staying late to work on them?
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;i bought a cd/dvd/vcd player.&lt;/i&gt; it's a fine little &lt;a href="http://www.sel.sony.com/SEL/consumer/ss5/home/dvd/dvd/dvp-s560d.shtml"&gt;sony&lt;/a&gt; single-disc, multi-function, multi-output unit. just the cd player is so much nicer than troy's muddy &lt;a href="http://www.yamaha.com/"&gt;yamaha&lt;/a&gt; "natural sound" cd player, which is altogether unnatural. the combonation of a good cd, a clear &lt;a href="http://www.rotel.com/"&gt;rotel&lt;/a&gt; amp (with "defeatable tone control" for a perfectly flat reproduction), and custom-made speakers from &lt;a href="http://www.stereophile.com/showarchives.cgi?258"&gt;andy payor&lt;/a&gt; himself can't be beat (although andy might suggest we use one of his turntables).
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;i got typhoid in my left arm.&lt;/i&gt; well, only a little bit. i went to the doctor's today for a "travel medicine" appointment. i was briefed on the health-related considerations for my upcoming trip to russia, and given a hep-a vaccine in one arm and a typhoid vaccine in the other. the nurse kindly warned me that the typhoid shot spot was likely to hurt this afternoon, or otherwise i would really wonder about the burning/stinging sensation in my left arm.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that's really not the whole of it, just tiny highlites. the next couple weeks are likely to be just as crazy. pray for me, if you're so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there's a reason i haven't posted in a few days... monday night, a coworker and friend from the past four years, &lt;a href="http://pivot.net/~stymie/"&gt;greg davis&lt;/a&gt;, was killed in a car accident. suffice it to say that it's been difficult at work, and will continue to be for a while yet. as is to be expected, thoughts of the temporary nature of mortality suggest that we ought to live our lives a little differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for example: earlier this evening, a bunch of us who used to work together at national gathered at a nearby eatery before heading off to the wake/calling hours. it was unusual&amp;mdash;yeah, many of us have kept in touch to some degree or other, but rarely all at once, and certainly not often enough&amp;mdash;but how strange and sad to be meeting for this reason! it reminds me to appreciate and stay in touch with many such friends who i care about. i tend to be the "out of sight, out of mind"-type, not because i'm thoughtless but because i get so wrapped up in the things i've got to do now. but there are so many things which are infinitely more important than the tyranny of the urgent, and mostly they are people who i love and need to show that love to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jesus, i'm tired and confused. i need your peace that passes understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;get me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i made it back from that ever-popular vacation destination, &lt;a href="http://www.state.in.us/"&gt;indiana&lt;/a&gt;, after a fine time catching up with a handful of good friends. more on that sometime later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but now, the harsh reality of work is settling in all too clearly. the greater part of the morning was spent going through the 140 or so emails that had accumulated in my work account over the past week, about a hundred of which have already made it the bit bucket. i can't seem to get &lt;a href="http://cpan.perl.org"&gt;cpan&lt;/a&gt; connected on one server which is going to need it. and i can't seem to get anything useful done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at least it's been quiet today, since my phone mysteriously broke. it's not the fancy double-line, feature-rich, mega-button phone on my desk that's causing the problem, but rather somehow my phone number got put on hold (so to speak) in the phone switch configuration. so, not only could i not call out on it (fortunately i carry another phone anyway), but anyone who tried to call me today was met with a friendly buzzing noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; everything but the girl's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=322142"&gt;amplified heart&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; with such a fine, flattering picture of tracey and ben on the cover, how could they go wrong? moreover, this album is smoother than a shaved kiwi...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;what i am&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i got a bit of a surprise in my email this evening: my last micro$oft beta exam earned me my &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/default.asp?PageID=mcp&amp;PageCall=mcse&amp;SubSite=cert/mcse&amp;AnnMenu=mcse"&gt;mcse&lt;/a&gt; certification! i didn't think the two windoze 2000 exam betas i took would count towards the nt 4.0 mcse, but apparently they do. now all i have to do is pass the dreaded &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/exams/examasearch.asp?PageID=70-240"&gt;240&lt;/a&gt; exam and i'll have my win2k mcse as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've been up in &lt;a href="http://camden.k2bh.com"&gt;camden&lt;/a&gt; for this easter weekend, and this morning my parents left town, leaving me a day in peace and quiet. in a sense, today is probably the only day of rest i get during this week, but it has been quite relaxing. tomorrow i'll be busy with errands and homework all day, then early wednesday morning i fly out to indianapolis. i haven't nailed down the schedule for the next five days in indiana, but i'm sure it will fill up quickly. in particular, i'm looking forward to visiting with ben &amp;amp; kris over the weekend, then going back to my church in indy on sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this evening as i left the &lt;a href="http://www.bayviewcinema.com/"&gt;bayview cinema&lt;/a&gt; i walked down to the docks, as i so often do when i'm in camden. i'm in love with the water and the boats, and sometimes i wish that i could spend some time as one of the "water people"&amp;mdash;you know, the people who live on their schooners during the summer months, or the people who live out on the islands and row from place to place. and then i wonder how it might be that i could do something like that... perhaps i could force it somehow&amp;mdash;quit my job in may, get a spot as a hired hand and just live poor but happy for a few months. but that seems so foolish, although not entirely out of character for me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then it struck me like a james joyce &lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=epiphany"&gt;epiphany&lt;/a&gt;, and it is much bigger than just my fantasy of the carefree boating life. the verse i had been reading earlier today is a promise; it's a promise that i have every reason in the world to believe that god will keep, because he's always proved true so far.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;delight yourself in the lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="right"&gt;psalm 37:4, niv&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;work is hell. that's all i have to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;financial upkeep is a lot easier if you enter your transactions as you go rather than saving up a big stack of credit card receipts. now, in order to complete my taxes, i'm entering all my credit card receipts for last year. fun, fun, fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and speaking of fun, &lt;a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mybrainhurts/2001_04_01_archive.html#3166123"&gt;russ&lt;/a&gt; seems to feel embarrased that he's only read 10 of &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100best/novels.html"&gt;the 100 best novels&lt;/a&gt;. now i feel much better about myself, because i've read 13.5 or the board's list and 18 from the reader's list. i wonder how i'd score if they had a list of the "100 best computer books of this year" (my credit card receipts would suggest that i own most of the 100!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;and it stoned me&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;oh, the water... oh the water... let it wash all over me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i must say, one of the nicest little benefits we get at the office is all the free &lt;a href="http://www.bottledwaterweb.com/bott/bt_260polspr.html"&gt;poland spring water&lt;/a&gt; we can drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i used to spend some time in poland during the summers&amp;mdash;&lt;a href="http://www.bottledwaterweb.com/bott/bt_260polspr.html"&gt;poland, maine&lt;/a&gt;, that is. that was when i first heard the call of the elusive wild cow (not to be confused with a mad cow, which is altogether different). it was then that i also learned that the resisdents of poland, poland spring, and the surrounding area have a nickname for the ever-popular poland spring bottled water: they call it &lt;b&gt;toilet water&lt;/b&gt;. apparently, the same stuff that we pay a buck a bottle for comes right out of their town water taps, showers, and potties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on second thought, maybe the water bene at the office is not such a great deal...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another difficult but amazing syzygus session tonight. afterwards several people thanked or encouraged me for my (small) part in it, oddly enough. and now, as i get ready for bed, i'm struck by the thought that when i was 18 i could never have imagined doing what i am doing now. maybe the place and job aren't such a surprise, but the things that god is doing in and around my life are breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;remember the other day when i wrote in the jim eliot quote about god's plans? well, you should &lt;a href="http://www.ewall.org/weblog/archives/show.php?blog=2001_04_01_index.inc#3048971"&gt;read it again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
go and tell your neighbor, proceed with all due haste&lt;br&gt;
go find your wife and sweet family, there is no time to waste&lt;br&gt;
we're gonna drink out of that fountain on hill called double cure&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;keith has now promoted me to the title of "contradance evangelist," a title also bestowed upon ainsley about three weeks ago when she dragged joshua and i to north whitefield. the original saleswoman for contradancing (ainsley) was otherwise occupied this evening, but i still managed to drag along a couple folks. it's only my third time and i'm starting to look like i know what i'm doing (perception is everything), and i'm having a blast. this is very scary... who'da thunk it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my &lt;a href="http://www.dbwired.com"&gt;web host&lt;/a&gt;, who are usually on top of things, apparently upgraded the server this week, and had some problems. for a couple days, my site showed only the &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org"&gt;apache server&lt;/a&gt; new installation welcome page. i couldn't log in to check it out. then there was no response from the server at all, and i still couldn't log in. now it's back up (or you wouldn't be reading this, would you?) and i've heard no explanation. i hope they upgraded &lt;a href="http://www.php.net"&gt;php&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;did you know that &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=551137"&gt;the clique's&lt;/a&gt; song "superman" (later covered by &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=468299"&gt;r.e.m.&lt;/a&gt;) has only two chords? beginner guitarists, take note!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a few of us from syzygus are doing the &lt;a href="http://www.netheaven.com/~rfutyma/whatiscontra.shtml"&gt;contradance&lt;/a&gt; thing again tonight. be afraid, be very afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some words from jim eliot in today's lunch-hour reading of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006062213X/ewallorg"&gt;shadow of the almighty&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
dreams are tawdry when compared to the leading of god, and not worthy of the aura of wonder we usually surround them with. god only doeth wonders. he does nothing else. his hand can work nothing less. praise to the guiding god of israel, and that great shepherd of the wayward sheep. when he directs a path, no way can seem bleak, no instance dull.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's no wonder at all that &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;microsoft&lt;/a&gt; gives away their &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/iis/"&gt;iis&lt;/a&gt; web server for free: it is by far the most frustrating, most insecure, most hardware-hungry, and most tedious web server in the history of the world wide web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there, i said it. i feel better now. i hope micro$oft isn't reading this post. maybe they'll revert my certifications until i make a public apology!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;guess what i just did? i sent in the registration info to go to russia for a couple weeks this summer! it's amazing how god is working out this possibility, seeing that he had to cancel &lt;a href="http://www.wycliffe.org"&gt;wycliffe's&lt;/a&gt; "quest" program and all that just to get me to consider going to kazan. i've very much wanted to return to russia ever since i spent a few days in saint petersburg, and now i have a chance to both enjoy myself and hopefully be an encouragement to the folks in kazan as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the impetus for the trip was the &lt;a href="http://tatar.home.mindspring.com/"&gt;tatarstan global cultural festival&lt;/a&gt;, in combination with some missionaries who are there in &lt;a href="http://www.kcn.ru/tat_en/kazan/index.htm"&gt;kazan&lt;/a&gt;. there are a handful of things i could be doing while i'm there, including travelling to visit the sister churches of my parents' church. izhevsk, for example, is a mere five hours away from kazan by train... oh, the possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but first: it's late... i must get some sleep before work tomorrow, as my boss is starting to get suspicous of the pillow under my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sting's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=33157"&gt;nothing like the sun&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; do you know what kind of affect you can have on a drunk man if you only quote shakespear? well, it was an epiphany of just such a sort that gave sting the title for this album. (if you don't know the poem, you must go look it up right now! go ahead&amp;mdash;i'll wait.) and by the way, i just found a good site for a load of sting info and lyrics and such at &lt;a href="http://www.stingchronicity.co.uk"&gt;stingchronicity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;looking for the heart of saturday night&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's saturday night, and i'm beat. i thought weekends were supposed to be relaxing, but i rarely seem to make them that. this weekend has been no exception to the usual rule of craziness. (it's no wonder that every monday morning when my co-worker allison asks how my weekend was, i can't answer without thinking about it for a minute&amp;mdash;"now, what did i do again?")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night i was introduced to &lt;a href="http://www.serv.net/~dplummer/contra.html"&gt;contradancing&lt;/a&gt;, an old new england folk-gathering kind of event. a year ago my friends yana and john-nicholas had been trying to convince me to go sometime, but they were unsuccessful (and now they've both left town, too bad for me). but recently ainsley has been urging some of us to try it, so joshua and i mustered all our bravery and went for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...eventually, at least. when we first arrived at the place&amp;mdash;some old catholic social hall in a town near the middle of nowhere&amp;mdash;both joshua and i had to use the facilities, which we found downstairs. however, there was an invisible barrier of self-consciousness blocking our way returning up the staircase, so it took us a minute to coerce each other up the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it took even longer to teach us to dance; perhaps i should say it's a work in progress. but then i'd like to think i made good progress, and more than one kindly person encouraged me in such a manner, so maybe there's hope for my right foot yet! thankfully, ainsley and so many people there were patient and persistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;actually, i learned a valuable lesson. ainsley had some seemingly odd advice: she suggested kind of keeping my arms a bit stiff and out in the air. you'd figure, "this is dancing, wouldn't you want to keep your arms loose and free?" but you see, the friendly contradancing people will be happy to push and pull you around when you are out of place so that the whole dance works together, but you need to be open to it and ready for it. if you head off in the wrong direction but have an arm available, someone is certain to steer you in the right way. it's a good feeling, really, akin to trust. (there's an illustration in there somewhere, i'm sure.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today was likewise reeling&amp;mdash;i got up after only three hours of sleep to go to men's group, then headed home for a quick unsuccessful attempt at a nap. the whole afternoon was spent at the mall with many deaf and hearing friends from the asl club; the sleep deprivation did not adequately prepare me for hours of sign language, which is already a huge challenge for me. and for the second day in a row, i kinda missed yana, because we had studied asl together. (i still blame her for dragging me to the linguistics class, which got me hooked, and now i no longer have time for the asl classes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this evening i went to a revival service at the international church. i am rather unsteady on the typical take on a "revival"&amp;mdash;i find that many so-called "revival" conferences or tent meetings or what-have-you are pretty far from the impression i get of the bible's take on the word, and they are similarly far from the revival we experienced once when i was in college&amp;mdash;but i was pleasantly surprised at how beneficial the evening's event turned out to be. in particular, i received some well-placed encouragement, from the first conversation when i stepped in the door to a rambling chat over coffee with ainsley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tomorrow night's syzygus is likely to be wild. we'll be discussing men's and women's roles, so i'd best be prepared. i guess i can start by going to bed now and gettign some rest, so i'll say goodnight and be gone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2922656'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2922656'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#2922656' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-2891434</id><published>2001-03-22T22:29:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-03-22T22:44:06.226+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;here comes the flood&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;two days ago i didn't wear a coat to work at all, because it was relatively warm outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today, i almost didn't wear any pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not that i would've forgot to wear pants&amp;mdash;you know, i never leave the house without my wallet and keys in my pockets and a pager clipped to the belt&amp;mdash;but this morning i found myself walking around the house, thinking i was almost ready for work, but pantless. i already had the socks and boxers and three shirts to keep my warm (if you knew me, you'd probably have already made fun of my fondness for "layering"), so why would i need pants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now that i'm at work and it's pouring rain not in droplets but in buckets, i'm glad i have a good raincoat and hat for the return trip. wow, it's wet out there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night i stopped by bull moose records (a.k.a. my undoing), and i was excited to see that they now carry &lt;a href="http://www.peppermints.com/"&gt;penguin mints&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/things/287d.html"&gt;regular&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/things/33a6.html"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;. (sorry, &lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/"&gt;thinkgeek&lt;/a&gt;, no need for mail-order now.) the girl behind the counter told me a scary story...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she said that the night before this young girl of maybe 15 years came up to the counter all stoked and fidgety. this girl was so hyper that she was shaking. she didn't even notice the boxes of penguin mints directly in front of her, so she asked the employee if they had any more of "those caffiene mints." our concerned employee suggested that the girl didn't need any more, but the girl insisted, "my friends bet me that i couldn't eat five tins of these, and i've already had three of them, so i need to buy two more."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if ever someone had a caffiene hangover, i'm sure this girl has one today... or will in a couple of days, at least. ouch.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2805527'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2805527'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#2805527' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-2804422</id><published>2001-03-16T17:25:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-03-16T17:26:54.983+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;psychologists, take note! this young fella has proposed a theory explaining &lt;a href="http://phroggy.com/cgi-bin/page.pl?page=articles-women&amp;theme=whistler"&gt;why men and women don't understand each other&lt;/a&gt;. (according to the author's warning, only non-women should read the article, supposedly because women may be offended and/or confused.) he's got an interesting point there; even freud might agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;overhead while flipping through the channels the other day:
&lt;blockquote&gt;and talk about fun... how about napkin holders!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today was the start of my spring fitness regimen... i actually tried to start last week, but the "march into may" program at our company gym only started counting points this week. (we're already calling it "march into madness.," often by accident.) so, now i have so much more than personal motivation&amp;mdash;i have to work for the team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and what a team we have, i'm telling you... the team name around which we rally is: &lt;b&gt;solid state tofu handles&lt;/b&gt;. i am not making this up! you see, the voting for the team name was very close between these three entries:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;the love handles&lt;/b&gt; (my personal favorite)
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;beaucoup tofu&lt;/b&gt; (the french adds that extra bit of class...)
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;solid state devices&lt;/b&gt; (we had to have some geeky technical puns)
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;our fearless leader made an "executive decision" unmatched by any former u.s. president (except perhaps bill clinton's last-minute pardon of a rich tax-evader) and combined the names into "solid state tofu handles." i'm trying to imagine a mascot for the t-shirts... the mind reels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;oh, oh, let off steam&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday was a loooong day. i was just about ready for church&amp;mdash;and i had to be there even before the early service, because it was our deaf ministry sunday&amp;mdash;when i looked out the window where my car should've been parked, and it wasn't there. i was certain that i had parked in that one spot in front of the house, and i could see that none of the neighbor's cars were on the street anymore either. then i remembered that, the night before, a friend had mentioned seeing something in the newspaper about a &lt;a href="http://www.portland.com/news/local/010310parking.shtml"&gt;special extended parking ban&lt;/a&gt; only for one side of the street... sure enough, a couple phone calls to far-too-cheerful public works and parking employees (who probably get bonuses for all the cars they tow during the parking bans) revealed that my car (let me rephrase that: &lt;a href="http://www.ewall.org/weblog/archives/show.php?blog=2001_01_07_index.inc#1958194"&gt;my new, please-don't-scratch-the-paint, wow-he's-sensitive-about-that-car car&lt;/a&gt;) had been towed and impounded about a mile away, and that i would need $75 to retrieve it. since i absolutely had to leave for church, my roommate loaned me his car and had maegan pick him up for church (they go to that "other" church out in gorham).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eight hours later, we'd finally cleaned up from two church services with sunday school in between, a luncheon afterwards, and maybe 75 extra visitors. i had been using my (poor) sign language all day, and my eyelids felt like sandpaper on my dry eyes (hearing people aren't used to looking that hard!). i stumbled to the car (troy's car, that is) and somehow made it home. troy took me over to the temporary impound lot, where the kindly man told me that i also had a $20 parking ticket, adding insult to injury. i posed a few questions to try to figure out the sense of the rule, since on our street we have to alternate which side we park on each night, which would seem to make sense for plowing and sweeping and such. the kindly gentleman explained that, in essence, on odd nights we would not really be allowed to park anywhere at all. (had i been witty, i might have quipped a quote from tuvok on star trek voyager, saying something like: "captain, i must say this is a far more illogical plan than i would usually expect from you." but i was not witty.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the fees incurred for my little oversight were as follows:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;$50 towing fee (profit for the towing companies, who love parking bans)
&lt;li&gt;$25 "administrative fee" (to pay for the kindly man in the booth at the lot)
&lt;li&gt;$20 parking ticket (just because, apparently)
&lt;/ul&gt;
but i'm not bitter, really. just whiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh yeah, and then i had to run syzygus that night, too, since a handful of the others had gone to that "other" church in gorham to chat with the youth group. by the end of the night, i couldn't even sit up straight, but at least i wasn't drooling. eventually, everybody left so i could go to bed and dream about the &lt;a href="http://www.nsa.gov/"&gt;nsa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;listening to &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org"&gt;npr&lt;/a&gt; on the drive into work this morning (as is my sometimes habit), the voice of garison keillor came on for the &lt;a href="http://almanac.mpr.org/"&gt;writer's almanac&lt;/a&gt; section. he read a trio of thoughtful little poems by kenneth rexroth, two of which i'll repeat for you here, because they have nothing to do with anything and absolutely everything to do with nothing.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;herring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
the herring is prolific.&lt;br&gt;
there are plenty of herrings.&lt;br&gt;
some herrings are eaten raw.&lt;br&gt;
many are dried and pickled.&lt;br&gt;
but most are used for manure.&lt;br&gt;
see if you can apply this to your history lessons.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;lion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
the lion is called the king&lt;br&gt;
of beasts. nowadays there are&lt;br&gt;
almost as many lions&lt;br&gt;
in cages as out of them.&lt;br&gt;
if offered a crown, refuse.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(them there's good advice, if i'd a said it meself.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm working on my taxes! how fun! well, actually, it's even less interesting than that, because i hadn't entered about a year's worth of credit card statements into my &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/money/"&gt;m$ money&lt;/a&gt; program, which usually keeps pretty good records of my finances. (&lt;a href="http://www.druzba.com/druzblog/home.shtml"&gt;jeff druzba&lt;/a&gt; had a good comment about the program&amp;mdash;as quoted by &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/maggeh/"&gt;mightygirl&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;"microsoft money would be useful software if it actually allowed me to access microsoft's money. what good is it for me to see my own accounts?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it snowed again last night. now it's just getting annoying&amp;mdash;you know, it's that thick, wet snow that sticks to the shovel when you try to clear the driveway. and, just to tease us, the weather has been very pleasant and spring-like in the days after the storms. (by "pleasant and spring-like" i mean in the forties and fifties, and sunny... hey, that's warm for new england at this time of year!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm having a fun little blood-pressure/equilibrium problem this afternoon which, although not uncommon for me, is also annoying. a few minutes ago i was trying to write on my &lt;a href="http://www.handspring.com/"&gt;handspring visor&lt;/a&gt; and my hand was shaking so hard that the stylus was tapping the screen and the pda couldn't recognize my graffiti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've been meaning to write for days, but there were too many problems in the way. first, my &lt;a href="http://www.maine.rr.com/"&gt;road runner&lt;/a&gt; cable modem service was down for a while, then my 10/100 ethernet switch decided to stop moving the packets. and i never got any time at work, because i've been going crazy with &lt;a href="http://www.silverstream.com/"&gt;silverstream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ifsab.com/"&gt;ifs&lt;/a&gt; server problems. i've already had a good list of accomplishments at work this week, but there's so much more to do, it's overwhelming. oh yeah, and we had a big blizzard blowing around several feet of snow for the past two days...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; peter gabriel's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=298560"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; an older one, with cover art that could keep you awake at night. as one reviewer wrote, "you don't listen to a peter gabriel [lp] as much as &lt;i&gt;live&lt;/i&gt; it." i think i like this version of "i have the touch" more than the other one, which they repeated on the &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=298646"&gt;best-of collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i think i've found a new, practical motto, which will be handy for answering waitresses and others who complain that i take too long to decide:
&lt;blockquote&gt;indecision is the key to flexibility.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday four of us lunched at &lt;a href="http://adloc.com/food/grannys.html"&gt;granny's burritos&lt;/a&gt; after church at the international christian fellowship. i was so busy yapping that i had to tell the waitress to go away and give us more time &lt;i&gt;twice&lt;/i&gt;. oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for those of you who were worried, my new pithy proverb in no way replaces my motto for the year 2001, which i'll state again:
&lt;blockquote&gt;coffee&amp;mdash;you can sleep when you're dead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i must have drunk several gallons of coffee last week, from making it at home in the mornings to guzzling the new extra-large cups from the company cafeteria to going out for coffee with friends several different nights (minimum cuppage per outing: two &lt;i&gt;grande&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today was the closest i've ever come to going to work stoned (and hopefully as close as i'll ever get!). i woke up with a massive combo-headache, in which a crick in my neck had started a bad tension headache that, in turn, triggered a migraine. i was up for a hour, trying to do my morning devotions, but i could barely open my eyes because i was so dizzy and naseous. so i calleed my boss and told him i'd be late, and thankfully he was fine with that. when i finally arrived after 12:30pm, my bloodstream was pumping with one $15 &lt;a href="http://www.migrainehelp.com/"&gt;imitrex&lt;/a&gt;, 3000mg of &lt;a href="http://www.tylenol.com"&gt;tylenol&lt;/a&gt; and a few no-doze (yes, caffiene helps my tension headaches). my head was spining like a tilt-a-whirl, but at least i was able to get some work done. and i had to stay late tonight and tomorrow anyway, so i really didn't lose any work time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tonight i've been working on claude's website for the &lt;a href="http://mulenge.freeservers.com/"&gt;shikama organisation&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit group supporting peace for the banyamulenge people in the democratic republic of congo. i knew a bit about the unrest over there from a missionary who spoke at my parents' church, but last saturday night claude was able to describe many of the complexities of the situation. the website has many articles about the situation, so please check it out if you're interested, and pray for mulenge if you're so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we've in the middle of a big company slump, so we've got a mandatory shutdown coming up in april. it's kind of annoying for them to force me to use my hard-earned vacation time on this particular week, but then again at least it'll get me away from the office for a while. anyway, i want to go out to indiana once before the summer, so i've been munching the specials over at &lt;a href="http://www.travelzoo.com"&gt;travelzoo&lt;/a&gt; and trying different itineraries at &lt;a href="http://www.travelocity.com"&gt;travelocity&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple days, and i'm just about ready to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so today i'm having fun getting in contact with several old friends out there. so far i've talked with tyler and aaron, and tried to find a number for ben. (in fact, i called the office where i thought he was working, and the boss-man there told me that no such person works for them. okay... next try.) now what about the others, from the church and such? i guess i could email them later. it's just that i don't get to visit with everyone out there very often, so i'd like it to be a nice coordinated effort, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;i've been waiting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it hasn't escaped me that it's valentine's day, you know. i mean, for the most part i've managed to ignore it without a second thought, despite all the people around me with either high expectations for romantic evenings, dread of stiff calendar-induced celebration, or loathing for all things related to courting. i didn't really think much of it until now. you see, normally at this time after returning from the prison on wednesday evening, i'd be chomping down pizza in front of the tv with dave and troy. (i know it's nothing important, but it's a good routine.) but dave and troy are now out with their significant others attempting to enjoy the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but there's no need to throw me a pity party. first of all, i don't have any particularly romantic associations with the 14th of february, so missing them doesn't hurt me at all (sort of like my nearly non-existant birthday). but i am conveniently pensive, thinking about relationships and my place in god's will. for example, as i've been reading jim eliot's story in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006062213X/ewallorg"&gt;shadow of the almighty&lt;/a&gt; lately over lunches, i'm right at the place where jim and elisabeth are totally in love with each other but waiting on god's word to allow them to come together. i think i can understand that, because i'm waiting on god's word before i even pursue another relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm reminded that a wise man advised his son, in a that great treatise on love&amp;mdash;proverbs chapter 31&amp;mdash;
&lt;blockquote&gt;do not spend your strength on women, on those who ruin kings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="right"&gt;(proverbs 31:3 new living translation)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but seriously... there's some excellent advice in that chapter; it's wisdom, that's what it is. so don't fault me when i tell you that i'm waiting for a women who
&lt;blockquote&gt;...is clothed with strength and dignity, and she laughs with no fear of the future. when she speaks, her words are wise, and kindness is the rule when she gives instructions. she carefully watches all that goes on in her household and does not have to bear the consequences of laziness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="right"&gt;(v25-27)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
because, after all is said and done,
&lt;blockquote&gt;charm is deceptive, and beauty does not last; but a woman who fears the lord will be greatly praised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align="right"&gt;(v30)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
no doubt about it, she is worth waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2378575'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2378575'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#2378575' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-2359247</id><published>2001-02-13T19:11:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-02-13T19:17:53.466+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've been posting here a lot less recently, mainly due to the craziness of my schedule and the lack of desire to sit in front of a computer again at the end of a long day. sorry, you'll just have to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i had a busy but fun weekend driving around with mom, while dad was away for a conference. sunday afternoon we went to a retirement party for a couple who'd worked many years at the &lt;a href="http://www.chinalake.net/"&gt;china lake conference center/camp&lt;/a&gt; where i spent a lot of time in my youth, and i was ashamed to be the only former camper there; nonetheless, bev was really glad that i had shown up as a small thank-you for her years of influence. the older i get the more i appreciate those who've served as examples for me over the years and helped me become the person i am now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sunday morning i woke up with a cold that wasn't even hinted at saturday night. so i've been popping pills and lozenges ever since, and even stayed home from work yesterday. i thought i had escaped or finished with the various diseases that have been travelling around town the past couple months, but alas i was wrong. i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;like the weather&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as the skewed saying goes, "there's no business like snow business" in the northeastern states today. we had a whomper of a storm last night, with white-wash visibility during the thick of it and hours of continuous heavy snowfall. this adds up, of course, and causes one to make two statements upon viewing the piled snow first thing in the morning: first, "wow, that's so beautiful!" then, "oh no, i'm going to be shovelling all day!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;fortunately, troy got out there early, and then i joined him and we made pretty fast work of it, with some assistance from a couple kindly neighbors (one with a mission to get his car out of the driveway and to work; the other with a snowblower). the rest of the day was warm and fresh and spring-ish, oddly enough, in sharp contrast to yesterday evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;work was quiet but frustrating. it would've been a lot better if i'd taken the time for prayer and bible reading before leaving the house. this is a lesson i was most recently reminded of this past friday, when some time in prayer made all the difference in the world for how i approached the big meeting. it's a lesson i seem to forget with astonishing regularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;the destination is there&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, god has handed me an interesting change in plans. amidst all the daily fuss i'm dealing with right now, i've been trying to do some planning for the upcoming months and, by consequence, the upcoming years. last summer i had hoped to go to &lt;a href="http://www.wycliffe.org/quest/quest.htm"&gt;wycliffe's quest program&lt;/a&gt; for three weeks, to get a feel for how i might fit into their ministries with my idea for studies and missions. i was disappointed that, through work schedules and some of my own fault, i was unable to go. but i was planning to go in the early summer, and i knew i'd have to start planning early. frustrated that they hadn't published any dates beyond this march, i called today to see if someone could tell me the summer schedule, and they told me that quest is being phased out. in the future, they'll only accept real applicants, and run the approved applicants through a similar two-week program. but i'm not going to apply yet because i can't join them until after grad school! i thought that going through quest would ease my decisions and waiting on the lord's call. well, perhaps not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mom had suggested that i try to squeeze in the march session, because we're supposed to have a week shutdown from work anyway. but i don't think i can miss three weeks of my class, which is equally important to my future decisions. (last semester i missed only one class due to the trip to ireland, and that caused all kinds of pain catching up on the homework.) i haven't told her yet that quest is being cancelled, but i still doubt that i should try to squeeze this in so soon. oh, now i'm all confused, and i've got so much more work to do today, so i don't have time to worry about this!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2207003'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2207003'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#2207003' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-2186428</id><published>2001-01-31T06:16:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-01-31T06:20:11.733+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;again, apologies for yesterday's wacky posts. i had really meant to be serious, especially with that wholly appropriate quote and all, but it just didn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as i was driving to work this morning, the freezing rain was just beginning. my windsheild hadn't frosted overnight, but it was actually steadily collecting ice during the five-minute drive. throughout the day at work we kept hearing horror stories about the icy weather, including rumor of a fatal accident on the turnpike. &lt;a href="http://www.usm.maine.edu"&gt;usm&lt;/a&gt; even cancelled their evening classes, which is rare. so when i finally left work at 5:30 or so, i didn't really want to drive strait home in the commuter traffic, so i stayed in south portland and saw the recently released movie &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0241303"&gt;chocolat&lt;/a&gt; (recommended).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even hours later, when the freezing rain had turned to a soaking rain on top of the ice, coming home was amusing. forty miles per hour (the temporary speed limit on 295 during severe weather conditions) was pushing the limits of safety. and then, after surviving the roads and the stupid drivers, i had to brave the walk into my house. the slight slope at the foot of the driveway was a real challenge, and the brick sidewalk in front of the house was just wild&amp;mdash;i couldn't even walk straight for all the slippage. what an odd winter this has been.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2186428'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2186428'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#2186428' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-2173186</id><published>2001-01-30T07:18:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-01-31T05:59:40.880+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i found this excerpt from jim elliot's journals in reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006062213X/ewallorg"&gt;shadow of the almighty&lt;/a&gt; over lunch today:
&lt;blockquote&gt;last night those great, sweeping desires for the glory of god seized on me, seasons when the thoughts pour ahead of the words in prayer and my attitude is as one having great gasps of want. desire there is aplenty. words are few at such times and faith, i must admit, is not really great.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
i realize that yesterday's post was wholly inadequate in expressing the contrast between the sentiment of the morning (oh, africa!) and the evening (this land is your land, this land is my land). i assure you, what i really meant was what jim wrote, but i of course could not write it because it had already been written (to sir or madam with love).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;perhaps i should spend more time sleeping (working five to nine) and less time reading random frivolity at &lt;a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/"&gt;timothy mcsweeney's internet tendency&lt;/a&gt;. to that end, i shall endeavor to go to bed forthrightly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2173121'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2173121'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#2173121' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-2159584</id><published>2001-01-29T06:43:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-01-29T06:43:28.476+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;wishing that&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this morning i went to the international christian fellowship that meets up on munjoy hill. it's a fairly new church of people from several different nationalities (although primarily african, as evidenced by the use of the swahili language), and it continues to grow in faith and numbers. i truly enjoyed singing along, even surprising myself at how i was able to figure out the songs in swahili. the fellowship and the message were so encouraging for me, although it filled me with a renewed desire to be far away from portland&amp;mdash;i long to be somewhere out in africa, where i would be removed from the troubles of my job and the trappings of our wealthy society, and instead i could dedicate my time to knowing and loving god's people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but i know that i'm not supposed to be out there just yet: god has work for me to do here, and training that i need before i can go. often i just need reminders of that. at tonight's syzygus meeting, i had just the reminder i needed to keep me grounded here: we had only expected a few people, but were surprised to find old friends and new introductions filling our little apartment. this discipleship group is one task that god has for me to do right here, right now; and i know i wouldn't be happy doing anything but what god has set before me to do. i'm grateful that god makes the work a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ow. that meeting hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;you fell victim to one of the classic blunders.  the most famous is never get involved in a land war in asia; and only slightly less well known is this: never go in against a sicilian, when death is on the line!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday, i slept fourteen hours out of twenty-four. today, i worked thirteen hours. coincidence? i think not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i worked late tonight, trying to get ready for the meeting first thing tomorrow morning. i'm a bit unnerved by it, because i have to present a project plan that (a) involves a good deal of work for a handful of people and (b) must be completed in the next five weeks. mmm, yes, i'm management track indeed... and i get to learn "how to win friends and influence people!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the fortune cookie that came with my shrimp fried rice tonight had the following prophesy for me:
&lt;blockquote&gt;you never hesitate to tackle the most difficult problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
remember that you have to add the special ending "in bed" to decode the true meaning of the fortune! that changes the message to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;you never hesitate to tackle the most difficult problems in bed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
that's exactly what i don't want to do tonight&amp;mdash;i don't want to stay up all night worrying about the stupid meeting tomorrow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;hats&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at five this afternoon, i had just got out of the shower and realized that i had only been out of bed a grand total of three hours. worse yet, i realized that i had spent over half of that time on the laptop dialed in to my computer at work or on the phone with my boss. i can't even take a sick day like a normal person!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but, that's okay. i got the rest i needed today in order to get through the rest of the week. the next two days at work will be fairly stressful, but i think i'll be able to accomplish several good things. then saturday should be a busy day, from men's group at seven to an asl club social at eleven to a hockey game in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;did i tell you about the hockey tickets? this was really weird... you know how the bible talks about "heaping burning coals on the head" (proverbs 25:21-22)? well, one of the managers at work who has been a lot of aggravation for my group and for me personally (back when i audited them) came into my cube monday morning to thank me for staying late last friday working on a computer for his department. he gave both me and rich (who also stayed late) tickets for the &lt;a href="http://www.portlandpirates.com/"&gt;portland pirates&lt;/a&gt; games this week. woah. that's a good way to start improving relations between our groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2111022'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/2111022'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#2111022' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-2078180</id><published>2001-01-23T00:44:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-01-23T00:44:11.886+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am not going to catch this flu this week. i can't; i don't have the time for it. i have some training classes tomorrow which i simply cannot miss, and i must finish a big project plan by friday's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everyone else has caught it. a good part of my group was out of work for most of last week with this flu. even my roommate (who, like me, almost never gets sick) has been down all weekend with it. someone said he saw on the news that some of the local schools have had over half of their students out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now i have some of the starting symptoms, including the beginnings of a fever. but i'm not going to be sick. i have too much to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don't often remember whatever things i may have dreamed about at night. but the mornings when i do are... disquieting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i only remember two details from yesterday morning's dreams, but that's enough. the first detail was... i dreamt i was a girl. (this is a first.) the second bit i remember is that i was dating a guy named gideon. (yes, like the judge of israel who kept leaving his sweaters out on the lawn.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this morning i only remember the very last detail of the dream, in which i turned to find a shifty-looking man about to attack me. i woke up&amp;mdash;very startled&amp;mdash;and sat up in my bed with both hands in the air, poised to give the creep a karate-chop beating. (i am not making this up.) i haven't had a single marital arts lesson in my life, but apparently i have the instinct for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1987552'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1987552'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#1987552' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-1985188</id><published>2001-01-16T01:31:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-01-16T01:35:26.690+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wow, it's cold up here lately. last night we stood in the denny's parking lot from about 11:15 to 12:15, watching while the tow-truck guy struggled to get maegan's car doors unlocked. i now have a deeper understanding of why penquins walk so funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my french phrase-of-the-day calendar has an interesting expression for this (I am not making this up):
&lt;blockquote&gt;"il fait un froid de canard."&lt;br&gt;
(literally, "it's 'duck' cold.")&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"duck cold"? what the heck is that supposed to mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;nkosi sikelel' iafrika&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ooh... &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0094226"&gt;the untouchables&lt;/a&gt; on tv this evening. and it'll soon be &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000541AJ/ewallorg"&gt;available on dvd&lt;/a&gt;, and i'm quite tempted to pick it up, as dvd would be a fine format to showcase the excellent cinenmatography in this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lately i've been on another french language kick...&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at my suggestion, my parents got me the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887290566/ewallorg"&gt;langenscheidt's french-english dictionary&lt;/a&gt; for christmas.
&lt;li&gt;at the mall calendar store's after-christmas half-price sale, i picked up a &lt;a href="http://www.frenchbooksusa.com/store/fg-002.html"&gt;french phrase/word-a-day calendar&lt;/a&gt; for my desk at work. (this was a break from tradition for me, as i'd normally have a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0740707051/ewallorg"&gt;dilbert calendar&lt;/a&gt; there.)
&lt;li&gt;then i rented the movie &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120449"&gt;the dreamlife of angels&lt;/a&gt;, and watched it again with the english subtitles covered up, for practice. (i didn't do so well!)
&lt;li&gt;some nights i read a little in french before going to sleep. (for example, the little old class-supplement book called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0912022302/ewallorg"&gt;suivez la piste&lt;/a&gt; is a "detective thriller" broken in small, digestable sections, with short lessons; one chapter of this before sleep a couple nights a week serves as a great language refresher.)
&lt;li&gt;tonight i realized that there are probably plenty of world radio stations with online streaming audio now. sure enough, i quickly found some links at &lt;a href="http://www.africa.com"&gt;africa.com&lt;/a&gt;, and at the moment i'm listening to music and news from &lt;a href="http://207.50.232.9/walf/"&gt;radio walf fm&lt;/a&gt; in senegal. how cool is that? (yes, i know it's not "french-french", but i think african french is &lt;i&gt;aussi belle&lt;/i&gt;.) of course, at the moment they're playing a disco song which is questionable.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;africa... i did have another reason for going to that website, incidentally. i want to go there... badly. i can't even begin to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

among the various tasks i'm working on this afternoon, i'm scanning in a handful of pictures that were waiting to be digitized. you remember that a couple months back i bought a new car? well, here's a picture of her (her name is zooey). coming soon will be some of the more interesting shots from my trip to ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i haven't updated much here this week, partially because when i've had time i've been working on a new "input/output" format so i can yak about things i've been reading/viewing or writing/creating. hopefully i'll finish it this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;someday i'm sure i'll look back on this website and find it very... amusing. i write this more for me than for anyone else&amp;mdash;you're just lucky that you get to read it. and if you're not reading this you obiously don't know what you're missing, and it's probably just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the other night i talked with my good friend and former roommate tyler, and he and elizabeth are now officially engaged. wow. wow... i'm truly very happy for them. and well, i've said it before and i'll say it again: it's about time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that makes two weddings i'm participating in next summer, about a month apart. in fact, i'll be roasting&amp;mdash;er, toasting&amp;mdash;the the newlyweds in both of them, which is certainly an honor. is there a complementary expression for "always a bridesmaid, never a bride"? ("always the best man, never the man" doesn't seem to work!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;patience, eric, patience. good boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...which reminds me, i need to buy some &lt;a href="http://www.bwspeakers.com/"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt; before july, when troy leaves with his fine andy payor custom speakers (yes, audiophiles, you read that right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the situation with the downstairs neighbors has escallated from an annoyance to a dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you see, i've been trying to be patient and forgiving with them, as i ought. this has included (as i've mentioned here before) shoveling the snow after every storm, putting up with early-morning acrobatics on weekdays and riotous parties late some saturday nights, and not running to the landlords every time i have a concern. (of course, some of these actions on my part are rooted in self-service, sadly enough; for example, if troy or i didn't shovel the snow in the driveway when it's their month to park there, by the time our month came around we wouldn't be able to get the cars in.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, now the landlords have just about had it with them, since they moved in a boyfriend a month or two ago without asking. and i've just about had it with them, as last night i had to listen to them partying until three in the morning, when i wanted to be up good and early this morning before church. usually they're done by two a.m., but last night both the live-in boyfriend and the other guest stayed for the night, so they had no reason to pack it up and go home. the "guests" are getting to be common enough that i can't tell whether the girls just change boyfriends on a weekly basis or they're running a brothel down there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night i lay awake thinking of the letter i'd like to write to the landlords, which would include all my grievances and a plea to do something about it; after all, my landlord was recently saying that bad tenants (the girls) tend to push out the good tenants (us), and i'm inclined to agree. just thinking about all this stirred up a pot full of bitterness in me, and that is a poison i do not wish to cook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;speaking to the jewish religious leaders of the day and quoting from the old testament, jesus said, "but go and learn what this means: 'i desire mercy, not sacrifice'" (matthew 9:13, niv). herein lies my concern: i do want to understand the meaning of this, and i do want to show mercy to those i meet, because god has shown me mercy. i should be merciful to my neighbors, but it's so hard to push down my own sense of being wronged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;looks to me like god's trying to teach me patience again. i wish he'd hurry up and get it over with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;more snow today, even a parking ban for the night. (fortunately, i live across the street from an elementary school where we can park on such nights.) i don't know why i keep shovelling the girls out&amp;mdash;we're supposed to "share" the snow removal duties, and troy and i don't even have the driveway this month. oh yeah, now i remember: if they don't shovel all month, then we'll barely be able to get our cars in the driveway next month when we have it. dang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;got a movie tonight, just for me: &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0120449"&gt;the dreamlife of angels&lt;/a&gt;. en fran&amp;ccedil;ais... c'est aussi bon, non? i'll let you know how i like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;maybe i'm amazed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;finally did something smart: i installed the &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/"&gt;apache web server&lt;/a&gt; with both &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/"&gt;php&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/"&gt;perl&lt;/a&gt; on my home pc, so i can troubleshoot dynamic pages and such locally, without ftp'ing them up to my web host (&lt;a href="http://www.dbwired.com"&gt;db|wired&lt;/a&gt;, highly recommended, btw).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'd like to set up the ol' dilbert archives cgi&amp;mdash;you know, the one from &lt;a href="http://www.webtechniques.com/archives/1997/07/perl/"&gt;randy's column&lt;/a&gt; a couple years ago? figures, it works fine on my newly-configured home pc-server, but the dang web host just doesn't like it. in a day or two i'll realize that it's something really stupid, like incorrect file permissions or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maybe i should just go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1865165'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1865165'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#1865165' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-1863365</id><published>2001-01-06T04:04:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-01-06T04:32:09.200+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;lately when i'm sitting at my home computer i could swear that i'm hearing voices, sounds, music and such, as if there were a radio playing somewhere above the ceiling. when i stand up and wander around the apartment, i don't hear anything&amp;mdash;no tv sounds from the girls downstairs, no people on the street. sometimes i turn up the speakers on my pc, just to check that no sound is playing&amp;mdash;but there's only static.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;perhaps i don't get out enough. or maybe i'm just out too much. either way, i'm losing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; tara maclean's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1158118"&gt;passenger&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; i'm in just the right mood for this disc. i could stare for hours at the picture on the back of the jewel case. (objects in mirror are closer than they appear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, now i'm really annoyed. &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/"&gt;blogger's&lt;/a&gt; servers lost a big post i had written, and i had even copied the text to the windoze clipboard "just in case," but of course i'd copied something else over it by the time the error message came back. then i started another shorter post, and the web browser window got taken over by another url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;please contribue to the &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/server_fund.pyra"&gt;blogger server fund&lt;/a&gt;. they deserve it, and they obviously need it right now to get some more servers up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in summary, what i had written about earlier was the following:&lt;br&gt;
(a) the four-foot tall snowbank blocking my driveway when i arrived home monday night took a lot of the joy out of the previous days' snowstorm, but it's all clear now&lt;br&gt;
(b) compiling open source software on &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris"/&gt;sun solaris&lt;/a&gt; stinks, but at work today i mangaged to overcome the stench and successfully compile &lt;a href="http://www.openssh.com"&gt;openssh&lt;/a&gt;, among other things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh yeah, and my co-worker aaron lit off his christmas tree with no less than half a gallon of gasoline in 25-foot tower of fire in his backyard this weekend. apparently, this will become a new tradition for their family.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1851398'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1851398'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#1851398' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-1842559</id><published>2001-01-03T07:48:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2001-01-03T08:04:33.986+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here's the obligatory "happy new year" message. yes, i know the date on the posting says it's already the third of january.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know, i often wonder about all the hoopla (yes, hoopla) we put into celebrating special days such as new year's. i suppose there's some value in demarking the day as a point of passage&amp;mdash;out with the old, in with the new&amp;mdash;along with reflecting on the past and making commitments for the future. but then again, it's just another day, no different than the day before or after. not unlike birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my 26th birthday was a week and a half ago. i forgot to mention it here because, well, it's not all that significant to me. you see, i was born on christmas eve, so celebrations of my birthday are overshadowed by a certain holiday which immediately follows. oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sandra cisneros explains it from the point of view of a young girl in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679738568/ewallorg"&gt;woman hollering creek and other stories&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;what they don't understand about birthdays and what they never tell you is that when you're eleven, you're also ten, and nine, and eight, and seven, and six, and five, and four, and three, and two, and one. and when you wake up on your eleventh birthday you expect to feel eleven, but you don't. you open your eyes and everything's like yesterday, only it's today. and you don't feel eleven at all. you feel like you're still ten. and you are&amp;mdash;underneath the year that makes you eleven.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; edie brickell and the new bohemians &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=298612"&gt;shooting rubberbands at the stars&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; edie and the band's debut, with the hit that no one could forget, "what i am." but there is plenty more on this disc, suitable for any light-but-thoughtful mood. however, i'm compelled to mention that their second album, &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=298642"&gt;ghost of a dog&lt;/a&gt;, is so loaded with treasures that most value investors agree that it's a "strong buy," sure to keep accumulating your ears' interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i made it up to my parents' place in the "quaint seaside village" of &lt;a href="http://camden.k2bh.com/"&gt;camden&lt;/a&gt; only a couple hours before the big snow storm started. it's been accumulating all night; big, soft, heavy flakes are settling and sticking to every surface. outside the front window, the bare old maple tree branches are dragging low, laden with all the snow they can hold. there's a blur of motion as countless snowflakes fall through the beam of each streetlight, diffusing the yellow light into a softly sparkling haze. somehow the quietness of this scene makes me feel at peace, and i thank my god for all of this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1816116'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1816116'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#1816116' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-1807729</id><published>2000-12-30T07:51:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2000-12-30T07:51:29.643+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;web coder geeks: if you hadn't figured it out already, i'm telling you right now that the &lt;a href="http://www.php.net"&gt;php&lt;/a&gt; scripting language rocks! you may have noticed that the weblog archive pages had disappeared for a while after i changed the web site to use server-side includes instead of frames. well, tonight i finally fixed that, and it only took about half an hour. i had barely even read anything about php before, but i decided to use it for the archive file parse-and-include script. a couple web searches and a handful of error messages later, and now i have a pretty darn workable little script. dang, that was too easy...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wow... i don't have to go back to work until next tuesday. how unusual! i slept until eleven this morning, and didn't even have to feel guilty about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tonight i got to watch another one of those probably-wouldn't-have-rented-but-it-was-on-tv movies, called &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0115639"&gt;beautiful girls&lt;/a&gt;. this one i actually had the foresight to record when i saw it was going to be on (a month and a half ago, and now i'm finally watching it). not bad... i'd put it in the category of "good ol' boys and good ol' days" movies like &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0112585"&gt;the brothers mcmullen&lt;/a&gt;. unfortunately, mcmullen's &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Burns,+Edward+(I)"&gt;ed burns&lt;/a&gt; would probably have done a better job both writing and casting this film if it had been his. nonetheless, the scenes with beautiful girls &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Thurman,+Uma"&gt;uma thurman&lt;/a&gt; and especially &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Portman,+Natalie"&gt;natalie portman&lt;/a&gt; made the film worthwhile, because they filled the lines and characters so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;according to the &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com"&gt;imdb&lt;/a&gt;, ted demme (who directed &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0115639"&gt;beautiful girls&lt;/a&gt;) said of natalie portman, "in ten years she's going to run the entire world, and i want to be one of her assistants..." hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dave matthews band's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=360743"&gt;crash&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; i told you i'd just bought this disc, so you knew it'd be up for a.o.t.d. (that's album-of-the-day) someday soon. anyway, i avoided dmb (that's "dave matthews band") for years because they were popular&amp;mdash;it's just a dumb pride thing i do, i suppose. however, a few months ago i saw dave (solo) on &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/"&gt;austin city limits'&lt;/a&gt; "songwriter's special" and was rather impressed (in fact, everyone on that episode did a great job: emmylou harris, patty griffin, buddy and julie miller, and dave). so i gave in, and now i'm into dave matthews. so deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;so much to say&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i never did make it to &lt;a href="http://www.llbean.com"&gt;bean's&lt;/a&gt; last night... too tired. i did brave the mall after work today, and that was surprisingly tollerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then, at the bookstore, i bumped into an old friend/acquaintance from high school. these kinds of run-ins are usually quite amusing for me, although i tend to dread them, forgetting that they're usually harmless. whether unintentionally or on purpose, i avoid most contact with "past lives" and, in particular, anything involving the town of sanford, maine, where i grew up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i started to say that these chance meetings are often amusing, so let me explain. usually the conversation goes quickly to "what've you been up to?" and my answers to this query often surprise the other person. &lt;i&gt;"well, i'm a system engineer over at &lt;a href="http://www.national.com"&gt;national semiconductor&lt;/a&gt;..."&lt;/i&gt; is almost always followed by, "but didn't you go to college for english or something?" &lt;i&gt;yes, yes i did. but that was boring. now i'm into computers. that's boring, too. someday i'll go away to study linguistics.&lt;/i&gt; some people are horribly confused by the twisty course my life has taken, and i like to feed their bewilderment. if i'm lucky, they'll ask questions which lead to me talking about going into the prisons on wednesday nights, and i just love to watch people's reactions to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;patrick, who i saw tonight, was not particularly surprised. after all, he's an interesting person himself&amp;mdash;he's currently working in venture capital for latin america (yes, such a thing does exist) and living in new york (presumably nyc). he mentioned a handful of folks from our high school who are also down there, and it surprised me a bit to hear that so many of us escaped from maine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but here's the best part: when i told patrick that i'm working with computers, his response was, "oh... i figured you'd be off writing a book or something." interesting. i'd be lying if i said i'd never thought of it. a book. me? i'm only 26... that's too young to write a book, right? maybe not... just wait, patrick, someday i'll publish a book or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dave matthew's band &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=412801"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; although this is just a short little ep with few songs that interest me, i had to pick it up recently (pun intended) because [a] it was cheap and [b] it has a dylan cover ("all along the watchtower," of course). it was definitely worth it. i also finally broke down and bought &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=360743"&gt;crash&lt;/a&gt; today, which will be the next selection in the cd-changer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;me and my tree&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;having recentlly accepted cable television, i am again reminded how strange it is to have random movies broadcast into your home at all hours of day and night. i've noticed they tend to be in two categories:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boring, overplayed "favorites" that everybody knows ("it's a wonderful life," "home alone 14," etc.)
&lt;li&gt;odd movies that you'd probably never have rented (including both "made-for-tv" and "straight-to-video" movies)
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tonight i watched one of those in the second category; it's called &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0116606"&gt;if jane fell&lt;/a&gt;. eric shaeffer wrote and directed this odd little flick, as well as starting in it along with sarah jessica parker, ben stiller, and elle macpherson. sarah did a fine job, which i guess shouldn't be all that surprising. ben stiller almost didn't ruin his part, but alas by the end of it he had&amp;mdash;in his own style&amp;mdash;managed to suffocate any good feelings you might have been tempted to have towards his acting. i'd put this movie in the theme category of &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0117357"&gt;the pompatus of love&lt;/a&gt;, although it's not nearly so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nonetheless, i'll probably look for some more films from this guy. but there's an ulterior motive: i want to hear more from &lt;a href="http://www.amandakravat.com/"&gt;amanda kravat and co ("marry me jane")&lt;/a&gt;. it looks like it's going to be difficult to locate the band's earlier albums, but i think i might give it a shot. i was at the very least impressed with the lyrics and how they fit into the film.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1777314'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1777314'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#1777314' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-1773678</id><published>2000-12-26T21:01:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2000-12-26T21:01:18.956+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh yeah, by the way: i hope you had a merry christmas. i certainly did&amp;mdash;i really needed some peace and relaxation, and that's just what i got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know my new car, right? well, apparently it was thirsty... it drank an entire 30-some-odd-ounce soda. charlie and i ran over to the sub shop to get lunch for a crew of us that are working today, and on the way back one of the sodas in the back seat tipped over and poured into the leather seats. all of it. and i can't figure out where it went! guess i'll have to find a way to wash it out after work... ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today is boxing day&amp;mdash;a holiday which i know little to nothing about, but nonetheless celebrate&amp;mdash;so according to my tradition i should go to &lt;a href="http://www.llbean.com/"&gt;l.l. bean's&lt;/a&gt; tonight. the warehouse store should be open until ten, and this is the perfect night to go, because every present that people return because it's the wrong size or color goes directly to the warehouse at a discount price you can't beat. this is where i buy a good portion of my clothes for the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; another streaming audio selection from &lt;a href="http://www.radiofreecash.com"&gt;radio free cash&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; so i haven't yet seen any of the cd's i've been awarded for listening to this online radio channel, but it's worth it just for the music. today i'm on the "always acoustic" channel, one of my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1773639'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1773639'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#1773639' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-1737080</id><published>2000-12-22T06:28:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2000-12-22T06:28:52.400+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at work today all of the departments that live in our big room had a holiday festival, which means that we had an abundance of excuses to eat and loaf around without accomplishing any work whatsoever, all sanctioned by management, who were participating as well. but as my coworker david pointed out, it was "the last free lunch of the millennium." woah, that's a daunting thought. i ate reverently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(you do know that the true new millennial year is 2001, the one coming right up, right? just ask arthur c. clarke, who kindly explains it for us over at &lt;a href="http://www.geekculture.com/geekycomics/Aftery2k/quickpollarchive/p210.html"&gt;geekculture.com&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; over the rhine's &lt;a href="http://www.overtherhine.com/music/recordings/cd05/cd05.html"&gt;darkest night of the year&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; recorded in celebration of their annual december 21st concerts, this is without a doubt the most hauntingly beautiful christmas album ever. a tonight it is december 21st&amp;mdash;the darkest night of the year. it only gets brighter from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;guys, don't you think that bubbles is the cutest of &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/POWERPUFF/index.flash.html"&gt;the powerpuff girls&lt;/a&gt;? i don't usually go for blonds; i think it's just some quality in her voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of course, you have to admit there's something charming about &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/DEXTER/video01.html"&gt;dee dee&lt;/a&gt; too. (did you see the &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/DEXTER/index.flash.html"&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; about coffee? it was brilliance, pure brilliance. i no longer wonder why some cultures define themselves by their relationship to this little bean.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1706148'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1706148'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#1706148' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-1703294</id><published>2000-12-19T00:55:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2000-12-19T00:55:38.126+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;the chipmunk song (christmas don't be late)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we survived the third annual syzygus christmas party last night. i wish i could say as much about the house&amp;mdash;between the foot traffic upstairs and the minor flooding in the basement, it's in sorry shape. and neither of us will have much time to clean it up until the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, our landlord's fears were confirmed when yesterday the girls downstairs moved another guy in with them. i believe that means that a grand total of four people are living downstairs. the lease in no uncertain terms states that no new tenants (read: "loser boyfriends/girlfriends") should be staying overnight without first contacting the landlord and renegotiating the rental agreement (read: "fat chance"). our landlord is convinced that the two girls who signed the lease and the two boys who didn't will all be looking for new apartments pretty soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; somewhere.com's &lt;a href="http://www.somewhere.com/playlist.cgi"&gt;live365.com stream&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; yeah, this is a little different. i landed on &lt;a href="http://www.somewhere.com"&gt;somewhere.com&lt;/a&gt; by linking from a &lt;a href=""&gt;bugtraq&lt;/a&gt; post, and decided to have a listen to the stream. the motto of "never boring" is appropriate... you might even say (don't forget the dance moves) "it's eclectic!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at last, i took some time this evening to fix up this website a little bit, especially since i can now take advantage of fancy features like ssi and cgi and php and other acronyms. the design is still the same, but i think getting rid of the frames and linkage problems adds a lot to the usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, check out the functioning of the new "links open in new window" feature&amp;mdash;now by default all in-site links will open in the same window, but all off-site links will open in a new window. the script initially came from &lt;a href="http://randomwalks.com/"&gt;randomwalks&lt;/a&gt;, and i made a few simple changes to make the default behavior to my liking. email to let me know what you think, if you have anything interesting to say...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; nettwork record's compilation &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1284750"&gt;christmas songs&lt;/a&gt;
 &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; i won this disc in a giveaway contest at &lt;a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/nitrosnagcam.html"&gt;geekculture&lt;/a&gt;, a favorite hangout for my daily cartoon fix. i must say i was pleasantly surprised... overall, this is a pretty darn good album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;how often do you think you lie? how many times a day do you answer the question, "how are you doing?" are you truthful each time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in america right now, the question "how's it going?" has become a standard informal greeting. often times it's not even meant to be answered&amp;mdash;two guys will pass each other in the hall, and both with mutter "how's it going?" with half a grin, but no one will answer the question. but if you do&amp;mdash;if you're one of the people who does answer this question&amp;mdash;your answer is likely to be "fine" or "great, how 'bout you?" you're not supposed to be honest here; there just isn't the time. "well, jim, i got up this morning and stubbed my toe on the radiator, and it's been all downhill from there... in fact, just five minutes ago i spilled an entire cup of coffee on my boss'es wife." nope, no one cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but that deal is okay with me. you see, i'd rather not tell you anyway. don't worry, it's not you&amp;mdash;i'm just careful with who i give that kind of personal information to. sometimes i think i ought to be even more careful. (let me explain.) for example, earlier this week i told a friend how frustrated and generally blue i've been recently, because i really needed to let it out. (you understand that.) but throughout the week he keeps asking me how i'm doing, and not letting me squirm away with some slough-off answer. i know he's doing it because he genuinely cares about me, and i should be happy about that; but really i'd rather not be bothered about it again. i mean, what if for the first time in days i was actually feeling pretty good about myself, and then suddenly he reminded me that i'm really unstable and weak? i'm fine, really... i can look after myself. i suddenly think: "why did i tell you in the first place? i should have known you'd use it against me later!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you see, this is yet another reason why even my own mother has called me "fiercely independent." that sounds like a good thing to me&amp;mdash;it sounds like i'm self-reliant and strong. but underneath that somewhere it means i'm just afraid to admit any bit of my dependence on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm fine, really. i'm fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we survived our internal software audit with only a few scratches. admittedly, it was very informal and not meant to be a brow-beating session, so we shouldn't have been so hyped about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday i was looking for some recommendations on how to conduct the audit, and found &lt;a href="http://www.spa.org/piracy/pubs/buttons_cuffs2.asp"&gt;this ad from the s.p.a.&lt;/a&gt; (that's the "software publishers association," not the "software piracy association," as i often say by accident). did you know that they've trademarked the phrase "don't copy that floppy!" so, it's not only illegal to copy that software media, but you can't even say "don't copy that floppy!" while you're not copying it. sheesh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;warning: the following entry is in geek-speak. non-techie viewer discretion is advised.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i think i just hit a milestone with the &lt;a href="http://www.expressmetrix.com"&gt;express meter&lt;/a&gt; sql reporting component, which i've fought with off and on for years. &lt;a href="http://www.wrq.com"&gt;wrq&lt;/a&gt; (the original creators of the product) had some bugs in their database setup scripts which caused some errors about missing components and inappropriate null entries, etc. also, i had caused some of my own problems by running one of the scripts as a named user (instead of 'sa'), so despite the fact that the user had 'dbo' privs, it still created some objects with the username tacked on the front. now, my &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/"&gt;m$ sql server&lt;/a&gt; skills are not that great&amp;mdash;one of these days i'll take &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/exams/examasearch.asp?ExamNumber=70-028&amp;ExamTitle=System%20Administration%20for%20Microsoft%20%20SQL%20Server%207.0&amp;PageURL=/TrainingAndServices/content/exams/70-028.txt"&gt;the mcp test&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn't really mean much&amp;mdash;but i'm proud of myself for this one. i had to do some messy hacking to fix up these problems, and it worked! now i have to write the company and tell them how to fix their blasted scripts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;thanks for your patience. the geek-speak has now concluded, and we return to our regular programming.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday afternoon when i was supposed to be doing homework (i'm like six assignments behind in my syntax class, which ends a week from thursday), i chose to file a bunch of cd's. you see, i have countless cd's (countless mainly because i'm too lazy to count them), and it's a heck of a lot easier to store them in a binder-type-thingy with the four-per-page cd sleeves, rather than in the bulky jewel cases. but in the last coulple months i had bought another handful of cd's, and they had formed a big stack of jewel cases on the shelf in front of the binders. thus, the sheer annoyance of having to move the stacks of cd's in order to get to the binders prevented me from accessing the old music, and therefore i was recycling the old ones ad infinitum. alas, now they are all in the proper positions in the binders, and i can choose freely again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ooo! you can get a glipse of over the rhine's upcoming album with their &lt;a href="http://www.overtherhine.com/music/mp3rarity/index.html"&gt;mp3 rarity of the month&lt;/a&gt; for december. the word is that the new album will be released at the end of february. yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is just too cool... the &lt;a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/hack-value.html"&gt;hack value&lt;/a&gt; of this is phenomenal. &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/"&gt;blogger's&lt;/a&gt; blog-of-the-week is &lt;a href="http://web.0sil8.com/episodes/pressnothing/"&gt;osil8's "press nothing to continue"&lt;/a&gt;... a group blog which is read over the phone by &lt;a href="http://www.tellme.com"&gt;tellme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so now the geek in me is already dreaming and scheming up ideas for this. of course i've already signed up for &lt;a href="http://studio.tellme.com/"&gt;tellme studio&lt;/a&gt;, so i can apply my recent fiddlings with &lt;a href="http://www.xml.com/"&gt;xml&lt;/a&gt; to making my own voice apps. listeners, beware!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td width="40%" align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;between a man and a woman&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bored out of my tree for some unknowable reason, i decided to catch up on some of the blogs i infrequent. unfortunately for me, infrequent is about as frequent as i get on these, but if there's anybody i do read it's often &lt;a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mybrainhurts/"&gt;russ&lt;/a&gt; (oh yeah, and of course &lt;a href="http://www.stormwerks.com/linked/"&gt;zannah&lt;/a&gt;, who finds the most interesting links).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, as i was saying, i was catching up, and i found his link to &lt;a href="http://www.iwf.org/pubs/twq/Summer2000k.shtml"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; which has three views on how gender (actually, the appropriate word is "sex", but no one believes me) is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a social construct. amazing&amp;mdash;a few scientists, researchers and thinkers are actually beginning to admit what physiology has made blatantly obvious from birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the third writer in the set, andrew sullivan, is right on when he points out that "one of the problems in this culture is our inability to talk about difference without implying inequality." you know, it's obvious to me that men and women are different... and i think that's a good thing, and that's something to enjoy. i like women because they are altogether different then me and other men&amp;mdash;they think differently; they act differently; they're motivated differently&amp;mdash;that's interesting and exciting to me. but for someone to suggest that when i use the word "different" i mean that i value women less then men is ludicrous. you mean to tell me that when grover ran back and forth across the little twelve-inch black-and-white television screen hollering, "saaame! diffferent!" that some kids just didn't get it? how "different" do you have to be to miss the point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;elisabeth elliot has much to say on this topic in her book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800751213/ewallorg"&gt;the mark of a man&lt;/a&gt; (and presumably in it's companion book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0842321616/ewallorg"&gt;let me be a woman&lt;/a&gt;, although i haven't read it and therefore cannot confirm). she encourages the reader to enjoy the differences between the sexes because god created them that way and saw that it was&amp;mdash;and still is&amp;mdash;good, and moreover, she challenges us to be real men (or women), to work together in the best of those unique roles. how controversial! how backwards! or perhaps avant-garde? or is it fundamental?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1595630'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/1595630'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#1595630' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-1591677</id><published>2000-12-08T00:06:00.000+02:00</published><updated>2000-12-08T19:06:44.186+02:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my old car&amp;mdash;the one i've been trying to sell&amp;mdash;has been parked in the lot at work for the past month or so. since my get-out-of-a-parking-ticket-free card expired this past monday, i needed to take it home. so i asked dave if he'd give me a ride in this morning so i could drive it home at the end of the work day (soon, really). that was fine with him, except he wanted to leave at 7:30am. most days i'm not even up at 7:30 in the morning, and i haven't been in work before 9:00 for weeks and weeks. needless to say, it's been a long day...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i did get to do some fun things, including beginning an eval of a &lt;a href="http://www.cybex.com/"&gt;cybex&lt;/a&gt; xp4040e kvm switch which we might buy for the new redundant data center. it's one of those "can-do-anything-you-want-it-to-as-long-as-you-install-the-right-card"-type switches, but of course they only gave us a few blades to put in the rack, so we can't really test the "switching" features because there's no other kvm output to switch to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tomorrow i'll begin building a &lt;a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/gen/topics/servers_storage.htm"&gt;dell poweredge server&lt;/a&gt; intended for &lt;a href="http://www.businessobjects.com/products/webintelligence.htm"&gt;business object's webintelligence&lt;/a&gt; (which&amp;mdash;by my experience so far&amp;mdash;is an oxymoron). i'm not sure if that will be fun or not. i'm not sure if i know what fun is anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;alright, i've got to get out of work now to go do some homework before class at seven tonight... ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i know it's been a long time since i last blogged. i do intend on giving it another shot, and maybe this time the habit will stick. (i tried smoking once, years ago, but i couldn't pick up that habit either.) in the meantime since i last wrote here, i have:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;named my new car zooey, after the character from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316769495/ewallorg"&gt;j.d. salinger&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gone to &lt;a href="http://www.goireland.com/"&gt;ireland&lt;/a&gt; and back for a short vacation
&lt;li&gt;bought a &lt;a href="http://athome.compaq.com/default.asp?ProductLineId=440&amp;page=families"&gt;compaq 1800t laptop&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decided and then not decided to apply for graduate studies in &lt;a href="http://www.unige.ch"&gt;geneva&lt;/a&gt;, but i might change my mind again
&lt;li&gt;played a census taker in "a walk throught bethlehem" (and there was no recount)
&lt;li&gt;walked the tightrope over insanity without a net
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today, i just completed the microsoft certified professional test &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/exams/examasearch.asp?PageID=70-058"&gt;networking essentials (70-058)&lt;/a&gt;, and it's about time (it expires at the end of this month). i wanted to complete it so i can complete my windoze nt4 mcse in january, and then later on in the year i can complete the 70-240 exam to get the win2k mcse as well (i've already passed the win2k security beta). 'fifty-eight was the easiest dang mcp test i've ever seen, and i got a 966 out of 1000, when i only needed a 766 to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thursday was perhaps one of the more frustrating days of my three years at national semi, and right in the middle of the day i get a call from the guy at &lt;a href="http://w3.ime.net/~mcelman/bath.htm"&gt;bath subaru&lt;/a&gt; whom i'd talked with a few weeks before. so he's got a great deal on a used &lt;a href="http://www.subaru.com/frame_main.htm?page=outback/outback_sport_splash.html&amp;start=outback"&gt;outback sport&lt;/a&gt; (formerly leased, still under warranty), just like i'd been looking for. fortunately, i had the foresight to make an appointment with him for this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, bright (that's debatable) and early (uh, 10:30) this morning, i met my dad at the dealer in bath, and i bought a car. woah. i wasn't expecting to do that; certainly not now, a week and a half before i leave for ireland. but monday night i'll go back, slide my butt into those leather seats (!), and drive my new car home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so now i have a couple dilemmas...&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i need to get my nice stereo components out of the old escort (joon is her name) and into the new car&amp;mdash;i spent part of the afternoon finding the original factory stereo and trying to figure out if the speakers will fit (looks good).
&lt;li&gt;i need to tell joon (the car)... i mean, i know she knows by now, but i really need to sit down and talk with her seriously about it. i hope she won't be too disappointed, because she knew this day was coming.
&lt;li&gt;i need a name for the new car. the problem is that i can't really figure out it's gender... you know, most car's i've know were female, and i have plenty of possible female names for cars. but i think this one looks like a guy (i haven't flipped him over to check!), so i need a good guy name. or then again, i could try to pick some non-gender-specific name, and raise him/her/it as a non-gender-specific car... such a politically correct idea!
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have so much to do... i'll write more soon. really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yikes! it's been almost a month since i last wrote here. but i have excuses, sort of... i've been busy, stressed, and somewhat depressed. otherwise, everything's fine. really. i mean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after some mishaps with the hosting company, i think i've finally got a spot for the website. should be ready in a day or two, unless i totally change my mind and restart all the designs which i'm not particularly fond of. i should just get the site published first, then i can fuss with the details (design and content) later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know, for years i've had this tape from a band called "the swoon" that is truly excellent. one side of the tape is the demos they recorded in a small studio themselves, and the other they put together at derri doughterty's neverland studios with charlie peacock producing. despite the quality of the music and lyrics, and the connections with derri and charlie, the swoon apparently fell apart. so the other night i was listening to the tape (as i've done many times before) and i decided to search the web for the band (as i've done many times before), and this time i finally found &lt;a href="http://www.actwin.com/OtR/month.9902/msg00240.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; (ironically in the newsgroup for my favorite band, over the rhine) with some info on what's happened to the band, and the possibility of getting a hold of a final recording entitled "spectacular illusions" which they never released. cool, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i should go to bed... in the morning i have to get up and deal with computers some more...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this afternoon i finally got a chance to spend some time reading my copy of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0028635051/ewallorg"&gt;frommer's ireland from $60 a day&lt;/a&gt;. i really need to get started on choosing an itinerary and making reservations at the b&amp;amp;bs, since i suppose even in the off-season they're likely to fill up. i'm so excited for this trip, it's going to be hard to narrow down all the options to just a week's worth. the book had a good tip, though: they suggested that you need to decide which you want to experience more of, sights or stories. if you want sights, you can drive like a maniac all over the country to hit all the important tourist spots; but if you want stories, you need to stay in one place and listen. i think i'd prefer the stories by far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;during syzygus tonight i remembered a poem by &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811210685/ewallorg"&gt;stevie smith&lt;/a&gt; which has always struck me as quite poignant, so i shared it with them (as it was pertinent to the topic at hand) and now i'll share it with you:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;not waving but drowning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
nobody heard him, the dead man,&lt;br&gt;
but still he lay moaning;&lt;br&gt;
twas much further out than you thought&lt;br&gt;
and not waving but drowning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
poor chap, he always loved larking&lt;br&gt;
and now he's dead&lt;br&gt;
it must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,&lt;br&gt;
they said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
oh, no no no, it was too cold always&lt;br&gt;
(still the dead man lay moaning)&lt;br&gt;
twas much too far out all my life&lt;br&gt;
and not waving but drowning.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one of the guys from work has accidentally made me a &lt;a href="http://www.scifi.com/lexx"&gt;lexx&lt;/a&gt; addict. only a few weeks ago i had never even heard of the show, but greg had a vhs tape that he let someone else borrow, and when i inquired about it he let me take it for a couple days. now he's feeding me a tape each week, because i'm hooked on the continuing plot (and maybe just a bit attached to xev). yeah, i know it's weird: i have a &lt;a href="http://www.twmaine.com/rr.htm"&gt;cable modem&lt;/a&gt;, but not &lt;a href="http://www.twmaine.com/"&gt;cable tv&lt;/a&gt;... go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i admit that my roommate and i are seriously considering getting basic cable tv sometime soon, though. our apartment is across the street from a massive old stone elementary school, so even the best rabbit-ear reception means that we get to see green shadows of every character. it'd be so nice to get &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org"&gt;pbs&lt;/a&gt; in recordable quality, not to mention bonuses like the &lt;a href="http://www.ifctv.com/"&gt;indy film channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.scifi.com"&gt;scifi&lt;/a&gt; (for lexx, of course, and the occasional &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0083658"&gt;blade runner&lt;/a&gt; director's cut).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the other day i was looking all over the house for my as-of-yet unread copy of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140067485/ewallorg"&gt;the puzzle palace&lt;/a&gt; (the expos&amp;eacute; on the cia), and i just couldn't find it anywhere, although i was convinced it should have been on the top shelf of the book cabinet. this morning i was glancing at said shelf, and of course the book has been sitting there all along. apparently, i was temporarily blind the other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my roommate is a &lt;a href="http://www.napster.com"&gt;napster&lt;/a&gt; addict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;watched &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119177"&gt;gattaca&lt;/a&gt; for the second time tonight, since dave &amp;amp; kim had rented it and passed it on to us before returning it. what an excellent, thought-provoking movie. probably some of the best acting of their careers by the three principles (ethan hawke, jude law, and uma thurman).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i guess before i leave the country i should read &lt;a href="http://www.csn.ul.ie/%7erobert/road.html"&gt;this article on driving etiquette in ireland&lt;/a&gt;. i also suppose i ought to have good insurance on the rental car. did i tell you how i upgraded my credit card for the extra travel insurance? well, now i will: the travel rep told me that only the mastercard gold or platinum would take care of the accident waivers (or something like that) on the rental car, so i called &lt;a href="http://www.citibank.com/"&gt;citibank&lt;/a&gt; to find out the damage for an upgrade. the lady on the phone told me about the &lt;a href="http://www.citibank.com/us/cards/cardserv/platinum/"&gt;platinum select&lt;/a&gt; edition, and explained all the advantages i'd get... a reduced apr (although i pay my bill in full each month), travel insurance, and so on. i mentioned that my current card has no annual fee, and she explained that this one would not either. i hesitated a moment, then asked her if there were any disadvantages to upgrading to the platinum card, and she replied, "no, sir... i've told you everything." the new card is in the mail now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first the bad news: &lt;a href="http://www.bn.com"&gt;barnes and noble&lt;/a&gt; is buying &lt;a href="http://www.fatbrain.com"&gt;fatbrain&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="http://news.excite.com/news/ap/000913/18/barnes-noble-fatbrain"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. fatbrain is&amp;mdash;er, was&amp;mdash;my second-favorite online store for buying computer books (something which i do with ridiculous abandon). fortunately, my favorite computer bookstore, &lt;a href="http://www.bookpool.com"&gt;bookpool&lt;/a&gt;, is still around. but the article makes me nervous when it talks about the "consolidation in e-tailing."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now, the good news (good for me, at least): i'm going to ireland! okay, so i haven't exactly bought the tickets, but i've got the reservations on hold, and tomorrow i'll probably call to make the official purchase. tyler and i finally broke down and decided on dates for the trip, and i called &lt;a href="http://www.isleinntours.com/"&gt;isle inn tours&lt;/a&gt; for more info, and i'm impressed. we'll land in dublin and leave from shannon a week later. we'll have a rental car, and vouchers for bed-and-breakfast spots all across the country. so, that means we'll have a lot to pull together before then (for example, making the b&amp;amp;b reservations), but that's the fun part. anyway, if you hadn't guessed, i'm quite excited. i've been a brittanophile as long as i can remember, but i've never made it to the british isles in any of my travels before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i started the &lt;a href="http://www.freebsd.org"&gt;freebsd&lt;/a&gt; install again, and of course it's taking all night. at least it seems to be fairly successful so far, much better than the first time i tried to fool around with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was looking for a temporary name for this web server, and i decide on "mirielle" after the character from the beloved &lt;a href="http://www.yale.edu/yup/FiA/FrenchinAction.html"&gt;french in action&lt;/a&gt; courses. i wish i could find the name of the actress who played that part, and see if she's done anything since then. just about every guy i knew who's learned french from her is totally in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now that makes me think... i need to keep up with my french, because it's been rather weak over the last few years as i've hardly spoken it. maybe if troy and i break down and get basic cable, then i can see if they're still playing the "french in action" series on the local &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org"&gt;pbs&lt;/a&gt; stations and perhaps set the vcr to record them. i should have all the books and such, as i made out like a bandit when my french teacher cleaned out the department library and then retired a year later.&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tonight was the first bsf meeting for the year, and seeing that it's only been just over a week since i declined to be a discussion leader for them, needless to say it was a little uncomfortable. several times, people referred to "the eric wallace group," i.e. the group that i was supposed to be leading and am now only participating in. how do i get myself into these messes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i got home in time to see tonight's &lt;a href="http://www.fox.com/allymcbeal"&gt;ally mcbeal&lt;/a&gt;. i hadn't had a chance to see the show in a while, and i'm glad i did tonight because it was a rerun of an excellent episode (from the first season, i think?). the one with the janitor who wants to donate his heart to the dying ceo, with the "cupid" guy who wacks couples who are "stuck in neutral," where ally dates the guy from &lt;a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/the_practice/prac_home.html"&gt;the practice&lt;/a&gt;, when billy and georgia attempt to shake up their love life (and the board room table), and we learn what it says on john's mother's tombstone, including her last word(s):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;joanna cage&lt;br&gt;
beloved mother&lt;br&gt;
ip&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
what a great show. i guess the next season doesn't begin until the end of october, according to the official website. maybe i'll try to make it a point to watch it sometimes this year. (new year's resolution: "watch more television.")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, i'm finally starting over with the &lt;a href="http://www.freebsd.org"&gt;freebsd&lt;/a&gt; build on the cheap &lt;a href="http://www.compaq.com"&gt;compaq&lt;/a&gt; i bought to be a &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/httpd.html"&gt;webserver&lt;/a&gt;. when i first brought it home a few weeks ago, i did the stupid computer geek thing and immediately began the freebsd installation without knowing a bit about the hardware on it&amp;mdash;of course i was entirely unsuccessful. so, this afternoon i dug up the machine a set it up on the dining room table (i have no room elsewhere, and at least there i'll have some incentive to finish the job and get the machine out of there) and ran the compaq-supplied recovery disc which wipes the harddrive and returns the system to the factory-shipped image. now i've got all the hardware info written down, include every i/o address and such. also, i took out the cheapo 56k modem and dropped in an old ne2000-compatible 10mbit nic i had. lastly, i've copied out all the driver and software zips i might need (from the "system_sav" partition which compaq uses for the recovery build process), since most of the supplied software doesn't come in any form other than the recovery cd. so, tomorrow or someday soon i can begin the freebsd install again in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but for now, i ought to go to bed. i really need to keep going to bed at a reasonable hour and forcing myself to get up early. having a cushy job that allows me to come in at nine or nine-thirty is not good for me, especially now that the school year has started and i cannot work late most nights of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;guess what? i ended up back at the computer again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just read all about sleep and dreams (two subjects with which i have limited experience) from &lt;a href=""&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;. and, somewhat by accident, i stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1889945579/ewallorg"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; about a young bear who couldn't go to sleep for the winter. i think i just might buy the book: maybe if the bear finds out what's keeping him awake, i'll find out what keeps me up all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm collecting ideas for a mix cd tentatively named "television is good for your ears," which would include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cool theme songs like dido's "here with me" (the only good thing about the &lt;a href="http://www.thewb.com"&gt;wb&lt;/a&gt; show "roswell") and love spit love's cover of the smith's "how soon is now" (again, the only good thing about the &lt;a href="http://www.thewb.com"&gt;wb&lt;/a&gt; show "charmed")
&lt;li&gt;songs featured in commercials such as nick drake's "pink moon" from the &lt;a href="http://www.vw.com/debut/index.htm"&gt;vw ad&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;live spots from specials such as music award shows or the marvelous &lt;a href="http://www.sessionsatwest54th.com/"&gt;sessions at west 54th&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a bit from vonda shepard (and perhaps some barry white) as appearing on fox's &lt;a href="http://www.fox.com/allymcbeal"&gt;ally mcbeal&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ugh... haven't written for a couple days now, and i miss it. bloggin is a great way to unwind at the end of the day. however, i often leave my blogging time until the end of the day, and some nights i just don't have the time or energy to unwind. so i guess i've just stayed wound up the past couple days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let's see&amp;mdash;what's happened in the meantime? well, i worked a lot, but you could've guessed that already. my boss remains happy with me although i don't feel i've really accomplished much of anything over the past couple weeks. thursday night i had my first &lt;a href="http://www.usm.maine.edu/~reg/courses/LIN313.html"&gt;syntax&lt;/a&gt; class, and enjoyed that a lot. i've already done my homework (diagramming sentences), using autodesk's &lt;a href="http://www3.autodesk.com/adsk/section/0,,143026,00.html"&gt;actrix technical&lt;/a&gt; drawing program (what a geek!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i suppose another reason that i haven't written in my web log much this week is that i'm sick of sitting in front of computers all day. so i'm not going to any longer today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i really should go to bed soon&amp;mdash;i need to leave for work at seven in the morning, which is about two hours earlier than i am usually leaving right now. and of course i haven't had much sleep in the past, uh, months... so i'm pretty tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night i got to hang around with joshua and get to know him a little better. we had dinner at the bear (his first time there, after seven months in portland!), and couldn't stop talking so we went for coffee at java joe's in the old port. we kept talking and walking around town to different spots, so now he has a better idea of what portland is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;saw that &lt;a href="http://www.rounder.com/rounder/artists/hatfield_juliana/"&gt;juliana hatfield&lt;/a&gt; is playing at &lt;a href="http://www.theskinnyspace.com/"&gt;the skinny&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the month. i wonder if i can find someone to go with me (since trina probably won't want to come up here on a monday night).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;got a reply letter from the bsf leader-guy. he responds point-by-point, and explains that he understands my reasoning and agrees that perhaps i should not be a leader for them, but nonetheless encouraging me to at least go as a participant (which i'm willing to try). i'm glad he took it so well, and that it worked out well. funny how god does that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;people keep asking how my holiday weekend was... and i keep forgetting it's tuesday. i'm still in a bit of a daze from the drive in from camden this morning, that's my excuse. but yeah, i did have a good weekend, although parts of saturday were unpleasant (see my last post) and i'm just as tired as i was friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sunday afternoon i went to the &lt;a href="http://www.portlandseadogs.com/"&gt;seadogs&lt;/a&gt; game with brazier. they did this little stunt to thank the fans for making the franchise successful (over the years i've lived in maine i've seen two local minor league baseball teams go belly-up, but this third one is looking good so far, where they had the players wearing 1917 replica uniforms and to start the game they came walking out of a mock corn field at the center-field wall, just like in the movie &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0097351"&gt;field of dreams&lt;/a&gt;. cute. i kept thinking, &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0097878"&gt;"if you go there, take a jacket"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday i enjoyed some relaxation and a lot of good conversation with my parents up in camden. since my roommate is getting married next summer, i'm starting to think about getting out of portland around that time and heading to graduate school, but that means i have a lot of decisions to make and tasks to pull off before then, so we talked quite a bit about that. also, we stopped at an antique store, and i found a large oval license plate from stuttgart of unidentified age (german plates are a lot smaller now), to go with my home office "car theme" (license plates from numerous states, a shiny hub from a vw, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so now i'm back at work, desperately trying to package the &lt;a href="http://www.hyperion.com/eo.cfm"&gt;hyperion essbase&lt;/a&gt; client programs so we can install them on the training lab pc's before thursday, and then on all the desktop pc's for the users who need this current version. ugh. it's great to be back at work, i didn't realize how little i missed it yesterday.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; indigo girls' &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=319290"&gt;1200 curfews&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; the girls live and unfettered... couldn't be any more perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i got up before seven and made it to the bsf leader's meeting without incident this morning, despite the fact that i haven't had more than four hours of sleep per night this whole week. perhaps the slight sleep deprivation had some effect on my view of the meeting, but i'd like to think i was clear-headed, especially since i've spent most of the day worrying about the decision whether to accept the leadership position or not. all told, i spent a couple hours on the phone with dawna and then my parents, all of whom counseled that i heed the feeling i was having that i should refuse the offer. so, i just finished writing a letter to the leader-guy so i can give it to him in church tomorrow, along with the leader's manual and other "confidential" bsf materials which must be returned (no kidding!). i am feeling much better about the decision now that i have defined and written out my reasons in the letter. my primary reason for refusing is mainly that i would not fit the rigidity of the structure they have set up. in fact, i'm certain enough of this that i don't think i'll even attend the classes and a normal member, since i'll probably just be kicking against the goads anyway. so that frees up some time that i hadn't expected to have this fall, which is great news for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i checked out the other course offerings from the linguistics department at &lt;a href="http://www.usm.maine.edu"&gt;usm&lt;/a&gt;. i'm already signed up for the thursday night "syntax" class with prof dana, who i particularly liked last spring. alas, there were no other options which i could really do this fall, including on the american sign language concentration (i'd like to pick up at the asl-3 level, but that class meets on wednesday nights when i go to the prison).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one reason that i wanted to cram in another class is that i'm starting to think it will only be another year before i leave portland for grad school. my roommate will be getting married next bastille day (july 14th), so i figured that'll serve as an impetus to move me on out of here. i'll probably keep the apartment through next summer and then move to arlington or wherever the school i finally choose is. in the meantime, i still need to make some decisions about the area of concentration i'd like to study (if, in fact, i choose to follow-through with linguistics as i've been planning), and take care of a few details (such as the gre test). suddenly, a year seems too short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on an unrelated note, i got to see katrina for a while this afternoon. she had emailed that she'd be in portland this weekend, but i responded too late for her to get the message and i don't know her mom's number up here. fortunately, trina paged me last night so we were able to chat and set up a time to meet today. so we had a couple hours to shuffle around town and watch me do impromptu unsolicited street theatre for one (a.k.a. "making a fool of myself"). i can't believe she puts up with me when i'm such a loon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; paula cole's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=203257"&gt;harbinger&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; according to the &lt;a href="http://www.brittanica.com/cgi-bin/dictionary"&gt;merrium-webster dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, the definition of "harbinger" (as a noun) is "(a) one that pioneers in or initiates a major change: precursor; or (b) one that presages or foreshadows what is to come." oh. now i get it. anyway, in sharp contrast to the latest paul cole album which i was complaining about the other day, her first album is excellent. trina said she likes "harbinger" even more than the critically-acclaimed &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=374445"&gt;this fire&lt;/a&gt;, which i've enjoyed since i first purchased it after watching &lt;a href="http://www.dawsonscreek.com"&gt;dawson's creek&lt;/a&gt; for the first time several years ago. so, i finally ordered "harbinger" like i'd been intending on for so long, and it came in this week. i'm quite impressed. i even sat down with the guitar and played along with the cd for a while this afternoon, which is unusaul for me to do on only the second listening. i'm sure there will be many more spins of this disc for me, because this album is first-rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/757631'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/757631'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#757631' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-752760</id><published>2000-09-02T07:51:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-09-02T07:51:01.590+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just finished filling out the application to be a discussion leader for bsf and the note i'm attaching making exception to a line in the statement of faith. the note is typical eric rhetoric, a bit heady and overbearing, but heartfelt (sort of like this sentence). here, you might as well go ahead and read what i wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
concerning my agreement with bible study fellowship's statement of faith&lt;br&gt;
i find bsf's statement of faith to be a reasonable summary of the essential tenets of the christian faith leading into an understanding of salvation through christ alone; for the most part, i am in full agreement. however, there is a single phrase in the ninth paragraph referring to an &quot;age of accountability&quot;; the implications of this idea cause me some concern.  to this point in my understanding of the scriptures, i have found not a bit of evidence that god has selected a &quot;cut-off&quot; age before which a human is presumed innocent of any offense toward himself (that is, sin). rather, the bible clearly states that the only path to reconciliation with god is a conscious, personal decision to call on jesus for salvation through his death and resurrection--a point which is emphasized elsewhere in bsf's statement of faith.
the invention of the concept of the &quot;age of accountability&quot; seems to me a softening of the hard truth of the gospel, intended for hearers who cannot accept the total sovereignty of god in choosing who he will or will not save. it frightens me that an organization intent on understanding the Bible would choose to make such a concession to weak theology that is not founded upon the word of god.&lt;br&gt;
therefore, if i am to participate as a discussion leader of the local chapter of bsf, i ask to make exception to the clause in question, and refuse to teach in accordance with the implications thereof. if the elders of bsf find this a matter of disagreement, then i ask that you accept the immediate removal of my application for leadership within the organization.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now i'm tired, i should be in bed. i have to go to the first bsf leader's meeting at eight in the morning, so i guess i'll get to find out rather quickly what they think of my little tirade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/752760'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/752760'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#752760' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-748889</id><published>2000-09-01T19:06:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-09-01T19:06:41.793+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've just checked off one item on my life's to-do list: i've always told myself i would give blood, just because it'd be a good thing to do. you know, i never really wanted to get rid of the stuff before, but because of this little goal i had to try it. i've tried a couple times before but they wouldn't let me donate due to various reasons, usually vacinations or international travel. but this time i qualified, and it's done. check one off the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and as a lovely parting gift they were giving out a beanie-baby style plush toy in the shape of&amp;mdash;get this&amp;mdash;a fist-sized blood drop. and it's smiling. how strange. who the heck wants their kid playing with a stuffed drop of blood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;did i ever tell you that i can't faint? lucky me, i'm a medical wonder. no one at the american red cross was that impressed. hmph! see if i give them my hard-working blood again!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/748889'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/748889'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#748889' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-745740</id><published>2000-09-01T06:37:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-09-01T06:37:25.420+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;apparently, i forgot to send the check for the rent this month, according to the all-too-cheerful message on the answering machine. (suddenly, after two years of trepid tenancy for troy and i, both the landlord and the landlady love us, and we don't quite understand why, because it's been such a shock.) this fact was confirmed by my checking account records in &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/money/"&gt;microsoft money&lt;/a&gt;, who acts as my personal accountant. somehow during the last couple weeks, the little bookkeeper inside the program decided that i didn't need to pay rent again until november 25th. (i suspect a redmondian conspiracy... i think the software is mad because i haven't upgraded from the 2000 version to the 2001 version yet.) as much as i like the idea of not paying rent for a season, i have a feeling that the once-hostile-now-loving landlords would suddenly turn hostile again, and we wouldn't want that, would we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but that's okay... i'm drinking a &lt;a href="http://www.jonessoda.com/"&gt;jones soda&lt;/a&gt; right now, so the sky could fall in and i probably wouldn't care much (sure, i'd notice, but i'd finish the soda before i decided what to do about the sky). the drink is bright green, green apple flavor, dressed in a black-and-white picture of an early camera, and it's hiding a fortune under the cap. (i believe this fortune is suggesting that i should take up a career in stand-up comedy, but i'm sure it forgot to take into account how fidgetty i can be.) in the desk drawer on my right i have an envelope full of the different pictures from the labels for which i have high hopes that it may someday serve to wallpaper a bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i think i signed up with a (temporary) web host today. i say "i think" because i haven't heard back from them since i sent those e-registration electrons in motion this morning... check that, i just found they sent the email to the account i listed as "alternate". okay, sure. anyway, a guy a work recommended &lt;a href="http://www.dbwired.com"&gt;dbwired&lt;/a&gt;, and they're accessible and cheap, so i'll give it a shot. it'll be nice to finally make use of the domain name and get some nice content up there (like this fine reading right here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i love the new cell phone... i just spent an hour on the phone with my parents, which is in-state long-distance, and i don't have to pay a dime for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one of the reasons i wanted to call my parents was that last night i read over the stuff i need to sign for to become a bsf leader and i had some misgivings about it. i think in part i was over-reacting, because last night for fun i read &lt;a href="http://www.watch.pair.com/bsf.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from some messed-up super-legalistic end-times-obsessed kjv-only church in new jersey, which i knew would be full of garbage but i chose to read anyway. well, i guess i've made a decision how to handle it now: for my biggest concern&amp;mdash;a line about "the age of accountability" in the statement of faith i'm suppposed to sign&amp;mdash;i will write a little note about my problem with it, and send it in with the application to let stafford &amp;amp; co decide if they can deal with it... more than likely, they won't have a problem with it; if they do have a problem with it, then i don't need to be helping them out by volunteering. so i think that's nearly settled, so i don't have to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a must-read article: &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/etcetera/082900/chastity_belt.sml"&gt;below the belt&lt;/a&gt; (chastity belt, that is). i found this yesterday and mailed the link to everyone at my department at work, and the emails about it have not stopped flying back and forth. what have i started?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; paula cole band's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=795118"&gt;amen&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; potential subtitles for this album include "the saga of a failed race-change operation" and "paula couldn't find her r&amp;amp;b with both hands." &lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/sections/recordings/text/disc_fulrev.asp?afl=&amp;LookUpString=1092&amp;AlbumID=50662"&gt;rolling stone&lt;/a&gt; said, "this is the paula cole song for people who don't like paula cole." what the reviewer meant to say, but didn't, was this: "if you didn't like paula cole before, there's a slight chance you might like this album; if you did like paula before, there's no chance you'll like this album." if you hadn't figured it out yet, r&amp;amp;b makes me nauseous, and this disc is paula's thin attempt at a new sound. as far as i can tell, the real paula only sings on track 3, at 3:37 and again later at 5:31. despite all this, i did buy the album, and i do sometimes listen to it, although i often question my own judgment. today was one of those days, and i'm proud to have thumped it out at high volume from my car speakers during rush-hour traffic jams.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/738683'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/738683'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#738683' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-731589</id><published>2000-08-30T04:54:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-30T04:54:31.983+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i got a new cell phone today. nothing exciting, just a &lt;a href="http://www.attws.com/personal/explore/phones/nokia_5160.shtml"&gt;nokia 5160&lt;/a&gt;, but it's a nice upgrade from my old analog cell, and the best part of all: it's free. well, free to me at least&amp;mdash;work is paying for it, and i'll pick up the bill for the extra minutes above the monthly plan. not a bad deal at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i went through the red cross &lt;a href="http://www.redcross.org/hss/workplace/training.html"&gt;"workplace training"-level standard first aid course&lt;/a&gt; this morning, starting at the ridiculous hour of 6:30am. i'm not particularly impressed with this new course structure&amp;mdash;they've really dumbed-down the content to make it more "accessible"... bad idea, i think. as for reference materials: forget the old full-color books&amp;mdash;now you get a 20-page newsprint-weight booklet. and don't bother to teach why letting someone go into shock is dangerous&amp;mdash;you don't need to understand why you should do it in order to be motivated to actually do it, do you? so now the red cross is trying to train a whole bunch of people to a bare minimum of knowledge, so they can go out there and do good&amp;mdash;but what happens when some of these knuckleheads start dragging neck-injury victims out of crashed cars and putting them in splints? anyway, so this course was just to get me started; i will probably eventually take the &lt;a href="http://www.redcross.org/hss/hsfacts/fs3216.html"&gt;emergency response&lt;/a&gt; course or get certified as a basic-level emt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which reminds me, i need to look up when the next round of emt classes is at &lt;a href="http://www.smtc.net/"&gt;smtc&lt;/a&gt;, and i need to register for my linguistics class at &lt;a href="http://www.usm.maine.edu/"&gt;usm&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow. this fall is going to get awful busy, awful quick. i met with stafford yesterday about becoming a discussion group leader for the new bsf (bible study fellowship) chapter here in portland, and i guess i'm in for it now. the first leaders' meeting is this coming saturday morning. ugh... september is going to put me into shock, no doubt. i'm not ready for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;over breakfast at the bayou this morning i started reading dan taylor's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0830822372/ewallorg"&gt;the myth of certainty&lt;/a&gt;, which kim had loaned me. i made it through the introduction (or was it chapter one?) and at least i have a grip on what it's going to be about, which i suppose is summed up in the subtitle "the reflective christian and the risk of commitment." the author has so far tried to pinpoint the reflective christian as one who is paralyzed so as to avoid the risk of landing on the wrong side of faith and logic, which&amp;mdash;seeing the impossibility of logically proving god's existence&amp;mdash;becomes a crisis of action. if that doesn't make sense to you, understand first that it took the author a whole chapter to explain that much, whereas i tried to use one sentence, and secondly that i probably don't quite understand what i'm saying myself. anyway, i'll keep you posted as to how i'm liking the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tonight we had a very good syzygus group (you know, the fellowship group/bible study that meets at my house), and we're primed for more good discussion next week in an ever-increasing effort to be real and speak personally and not just hit the topic from an intellectual perspective... that's what the group is about, really&amp;mdash;a practical look at our own christian walks. as the group has continued to grow recently (we had a dozen crammed into my living room tonight, and that was without a handful of the regulars and the semi-regulars), obviously the dynamic has changed, but so has the span of people, which is fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on his way out the door, joshua suggested that the movie &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0133093"&gt;the matrix&lt;/a&gt; is more than the typical messiah story (think &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670841803/ewallorg"&gt;peter pan&lt;/a&gt; etc.), but actually a complete christian allegory (a la &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0800786092/ewallorg"&gt;pilgrim's progress&lt;/a&gt;). i'm skeptical, but... sometime i guess we'll get together a bunch of guys to watch and discuss, which could turn out to be quite interesting. speaking of over-intellectualizing... (gee, i miss those literature classes!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ginny owens' &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=773803"&gt;without condition&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; i had the pleasure of hearing ginny lead a couple songs and play a couple of her own back in january at &lt;a href="http://www.eane.org/Events/Congress2000/Index.htm"&gt;vne's congress&lt;/a&gt;, but i didn't buy the disc then, although i was quite impressed with her music and her sweet spirit. so last night as i was coming back from biking the back bay loop, i heard music coming from deering oaks park, so i decided to check it out. the local christian radio station that i never listen to (&lt;a href="http://www.wmsj.org/"&gt;wmsj&lt;/a&gt;) was having a "family night" and ginny was up on the stage singing, so of course i sat down to listen. after hearing the song "if you want me to" for the second time, i knew i'd have to buy the album, because i've been so spiritually dry lately, and the song (and others from her) would be an encouragement. and that it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the movie turned out all right, i think. i don't mean the way it ended&amp;mdash;she dies, of course, but if you have s.p.* you knew it was going to happen eventually anyway. so yeah, it was quite depressing, sometimes poorly scripting and directed, but the movie had a few good points, and i guess that makes up for the bad, balancing out to be an okay movie. no, it'll never be &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0054698"&gt;breakfast at tiffany's&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0111693"&gt;when a man loves a woman&lt;/a&gt;, for that matter. but if you like hyper-messed-up-junkie-girl-meets-clean-cut-writer-guy-falls-in-love-and-dies-because-she-took-another-hit-type flicks, then you'll like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by the way, if you've been totally confused about the titles i give these postings, don't be. let me remind you that every title is the name of a song which may or may not have something to do with the post. sometimes it's from the album-of-the-day; sometimes it's a common theme with something i'm writing about; sometimes it just is. for example, the title of this post is "why do you love me?", from the song that played while the movie credits were rolling; it has nothing to do with your particular affection for me, the author, and i wasn't intending that you answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="posted"&gt;s.p. (noun) = sensory perception. you've heard of extra sensory perception (esp), right? well, just plain old "sensory perception" is akin to "a keen grasp of the obvious."&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/709829'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/709829'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#709829' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-709280</id><published>2000-08-26T05:44:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-26T05:44:08.216+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i admit it: i'm playing "loser-boy" tonight, because i didn't make any plans for friday, so i'm a loner. i was looking forward to watching &lt;a href="http://www.dawsonscreek.com"&gt;dawson's creek&lt;/a&gt; (yes, i freely admit it&amp;mdash;i love this show, and i don't quite understand why), because i'm so rarely home on friday night to watch it. (i don't have cable or the wb channel, so the dawson re-run is on friday nights on upn.) but, alas&amp;mdash;it was one of the few episodes (#317, "cinderella story") which i had seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, i guess i'll start wathcing the movie i got: &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0164807"&gt;jane doe&lt;/a&gt;. it's look like some kind of rip-off of &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0054698"&gt;breakfast at tiffany's&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of my absolute favorites. i had never heard of this "jane doe" movie before i picked it up, and after reading the article at &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/"&gt;the imdb&lt;/a&gt; i guess i know why&amp;mdash;i guess it's not supposed to be that good. oh well... i guess i was just destined to be "loser-boy" tonight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/709280'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/709280'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#709280' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-703047</id><published>2000-08-25T05:09:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-25T05:09:37.686+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i finally finished that odd book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553348981/ewallorg"&gt;jitterbug perfume&lt;/a&gt;, just after work today. it was... uh, unique. i had never before seen so much drizzle about beets, smells, and longevity collected in one place. but, it's good to know and understand such simple concepts as "immortality is essentially a matter of rhythm" and how that relates to breathing and bathing as methods of keeping yourself alive forever... uh-huh, sure. i hope no one was really convinced by the author's arguments in the book&amp;mdash;after all, tom robbins had studied religion at one point, so perhaps he is using some techniques he learned from the great cults as to how to present a pot-holed argument convincingly. i'd bet right now i'm offending some "bandaloop immortalist" and disrupting his dance steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(if you haven't read the book, i'm sure that last paragraph made not a smidgeon of sense. alas, even if you had read the book, the paragraph might throw you for a "bandaloop"! ugh, i should quit while i'm behind.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i should go to bed. i've been up since four-thirty. i worked eight hours in freezing air conditioning. i've been feverish all night since i came home. my eyes are playing tricks on me and i can't get my fingers to type the right buttons. i should go to bed, but it's only ten o'clock, and if i go to bed now i'll be up at 4:30 again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/703047'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/703047'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#703047' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-699017</id><published>2000-08-24T16:05:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-24T16:05:00.950+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, this is going to be an interesting day... i never did go back to bed after getting up at 4:30, so i'm sure i'll be wiped by the end of the workday. i think around 5pm i'll be going out to "the thirsty dog" with matt and dean and their coworkers, so at least i have an excuse not to work late tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i've sort of worked out the too-many-things-hanging-from-my-belt problem. i was able to get rid of the clippy-keyring-thingy, because i gave away some of the building keys which are included on my ert keyring, and i was able to put the two little cubicle-lock keys with the personal keys (i.e. car, house, etc.) in my pocket without increasing the bulk too much. however, i've also increased the problem, because i think i'm going to "upgrade" from the ert voice pager to the ert radio, which enables two-way communication. factors which played a part in my decision to add the extra weight to my belt were monday's experience with the incomprehensible ert all-call on the voice pager, along with the lack of communication during yesterday's events, encouragement from my emergency coordinator, and the fact that i'm one of very few erts in my building. oh well. at least i'll always be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;had my first real emergency call today. actually, there was a call yesterday but it was a false alarm and it was called off before i even left the desk i was at. but today was real&amp;mdash;a guy drilled into a pipe full of sodium hydroxide. he's fine now, thanks to some help from a quick-thinking ert guy who was nearby at the time; but we did spend hours and hours today cleaning up the spill. those were hours i couldn't really afford to be away from the list of work i have to do this week, but i guess it's all in the line of duty. i think i'm really going to enjoy this emergency response stuff. of course, the calls are usually few and far between, and i shouldn't expect that it's going to be all fun and games... but i like knowing what to do and being able to response appropriately as the situation demands, so it's a good spot for me to be in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i did finally decide to kill the solaris 8 install and go with v7, which is about halfway through the file copying right now. i hope the solaris 7 dhcp client works as advertised&amp;mdash;the installer makes no mention of it as an option, but the admin docs explain how to create the file to enable it. oh well. if this thing doesn't hurry up, i might just go to bed and deal with this another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i am beginning to regret trying to install solaris 8 the sparc 10 which will supposedly become my home network's firewall, proxy, and dns. an operating system installation that requires three cd's is a bad sign. sheesh, even windoze 2000 only had one cd! i need to return the external cd-rom to work tomorrow, so i really need to finish this install tonight, but it's taking forever. i'm tempted to kill the v8 install and put in the single solaris 7 disc, which would be a heck of a lot quicker.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/690100'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/690100'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#690100' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-686232</id><published>2000-08-22T16:58:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-22T16:58:31.216+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have way too many things hanging off me right now. first off, i almost always have an alpha pager holster on the left, and a &lt;a href="http://www.hangware.com/"&gt;hangware&lt;/a&gt; watch fob clipped on the front-right belt loop. then when i go to work, i clip a little springy-thing of keys next to the watch and hang an access card around my neck (actually, a picture-badge, an electronic key badge, a &lt;a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/products/securid/"&gt;securid&lt;/a&gt; fob, and several little plastic cards of phone numbers and such). now that i've joined the ert, i have a massive key ring clipped on the rightmost belt loop and a radio pager clipped behind the alpha pager on the left side. oh, and sometimes i carry a cell phone or &lt;a href="http://www.spectralink.com/"&gt;spectralink&lt;/a&gt; in-house phone. sheesh! maybe i should find a place to carry my &lt;a href="http://www.handspring.com/"&gt;visor pda&lt;/a&gt; and i won't ever need to carry anything because it will all somehow be attached to my body somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night i was talking with troy and saying how i usually get annoyed when someone says i "have to meet someone" whom they are convinced i will really get along with. (tonight joy is bringing over some guy she works with to meet me, for said reason.) i mentioned that the only couple times in recent memory in which i actually connected with the person was two of dawna's friends who she wanted me to meet, ray and lisa; and the reason that worked out is that both of them are very real, upfront, no-bull people. that's the kind of person i really respect: i think simple honesty is a sign of integrity. (that's one reason i enjoy the wednesday evenings at the prison so much&amp;mdash;the guys i meet there are real and they have nothing to hide, so they don't have to put up a front like the people "on the outside.")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so this morning i was thinking about this all over again. i aim to be one of those "real" people, open and honest... but i wonder if i really am? i mean, take this web log, for example&amp;mdash;i can't really write everything i'm thinking about here, because i'm afraid that various friends of mine might read it and be offended. maybe that's a poor example. anyway, i wonder if people perceive me as open and straight-forward. i think i used to be more like that, but i fear that in the last few years i've curled up into myself more, like i'm protecting something (my sanity, namely). will have to talk with out with a friend, because it's starting to worry me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my life was rather uninteresting today, so i shouldn't even bother telling you about it. i went to work and putzed around on computers most of the day. i came home and putzed around with computers some more. the highlight of the day was getting a shot in the arm&amp;mdash;as a new emergency response team member, i got the option for a free hepetitis-b virus vaccine series... today was part one of three. sound like fun to you, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;speaking of emergency response, i found a good link today with a &lt;a href="http://www.osha-slc.gov/OshDoc/Fact_data/FSNO93-31.html"&gt;summary of the hazwoper rules&lt;/a&gt;, so i can better explain my new certification as a hazardous waste emergency responder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i think i might break down and temporarily host my domain with &lt;a href="http://www.netfirms.com/"&gt;netfirms&lt;/a&gt; until i can get my real server installed, secured, and running out at the isp. ugh. it looks like it will take me a while to get all this done, because i have so little "free" time, much of which i prefer to spend far away from computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of the usual syzygus group tonight, joy had convinced us to go to the portland first baptist to hear this guy named ernie play the piano. since we're usually not afforded the option to skip syzygus because it's at our house every week, we were both independently thinking about not going (troy said he had a headache, and i just didn't feel like socializing). fortunately, kim called and got troy to go (he was supposed to pick up maegan anyway), and so he made me get up and drive. now i'm glad i did, because i got to see a whole crew of people i hadn't seen for months, including people from the root cellar where i used to volunteer. michael, the head of the teens program at the root cellar, is getting married this saturday&amp;mdash;yikes! i don't think i've even talked to him since the engagement, but maybe that's for the best (i'm not bitter, really, just a bit cynical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, after the guy's program and a lot of talking, most of us ended up at dawna's house, and she made some kind of tofu-veggie-rice concoction that was really quite delicious. we were laughing hysterically and generally having a good conversation when one of dawna's roommates (deb) walked in the door with this look of almost horror on her face, as if she were quite unhappy that we were there. so, soon enough we cleared ourselves out of there, almost feeling guilty. well, dawna had called, and elisa was fine with it and deb was out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today was trina's last day at national, "working for dick." (yes, she really was working for a guy named dick.) to celebrate, we went out for dinner (fresh market pasta, cheap but goood) and cd's (bull moose records&amp;mdash;danger!). it was rather difficult to say goodbye&amp;mdash;we'd actually become pretty good friends this summer, despite the short time and the earlier difficulties. yeah, it was actually tough to say goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she had to drive home to worcester tonight, so she left a little after nine. i came home and, not wanting to repeat last night's lousy sleep pattern, decided to watch the movie i'd picked up last night but hadn't yet seen. it's edward burn's &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0117628"&gt;she's the one&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;not bad, not bad at all. i got interested in his films with &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0112585"&gt;the brothers mcmullen&lt;/a&gt;, which is still my favorite from him. although the story in this one wasn't nearly as good, the cast was perfect, including ed (always in his own movies), mike mcglone (always in ed's movies), jennifer anniston (yes, great acting), cameron diaz (who i normally dislike), amanda peet (yum), and maxine bahns (yum yum). oh, and i've got the tom petty songs from the &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=366845"&gt;soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; stuck in my head (i may just have to buy it someday). anyway, i'd recommend the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now i should probably hit the sack, as tomorrow morning early a whole crew of us are going to the &lt;a href="http://www.mainehighlandgames.org/"&gt;maine highland games&lt;/a&gt;. and no, just because my name is wallace doesn't mean i'm scottish (my grandfathter wallace was adopted), and i have no intention of wearing a kilt, ever. so don't even ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm beginning to think there are some positive advantages to chronic insomnia like mine. think about it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;more solitude&lt;dd&gt;while everyone else is asleep, you get a quiet house to yourself (as long as you don't make too much noise)
&lt;dt&gt;faster internet access&lt;dd&gt;at 4am, even the hackers have probably gone to bed, and the download speeds in north america are crisp
&lt;dt&gt;unpredictable nights and days&lt;dd&gt;no matter how important tomorrow morning may be, your body may simply refuse the sleep you need to be a normal person
&lt;dt&gt;built-in excuse&lt;dd&gt;you can train your boss to feel sorry for you (instead of scolding) when you come in to work late, because he knows about your "condition"
&lt;dt&gt;more free time&lt;dd&gt;everyone else needs seven or more hours of sleep per night, but you have 20 or more waking hours in a day
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;have you read the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679746048/ewallorg"&gt;girl, interrupted&lt;/a&gt; by susanna kaysen? the recent &lt;a href-"http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/jump/girlinterrupted.html"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt; was more or less based on this true story, but if the question of insanity interests you at all, you should read the book. anyway... in the book, the character/girl lisa doesn't sleep, at all. she sits in a rocking chair in the hallway, chats with the nurses on duty, and also makes them hot cocoa; but she doesn't sleep. but the difference is that during the daytime she was wild, but at night she was calm; when inquired about this, she responded something to the effect of, "just because i don't sleep doesn't mean i don't need rest." okay, i can understand that, and maybe even aspire to it. i know how crazy my life can be during the day, and sometimes i pay for it during the night by worrying about all the things i'm trying to do. but for years i've been a frustrated insomniac, always tossing and turning, obsessing with the clock, and whining about it the next day. perhaps i'm learning to be a peaceful insomniac, to calm down and rest, doing quiet things like i'm doing right now: writing a journal that i wouldn't otherwise have time to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's nearly quarter past four now, so i think i'll try to hit the sack for another couple hours. but if i don't sleep, i'll just have to deal with it, right? and the best way to do that is to be peaceful about it, so that's what i'm going to do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/662933'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/662933'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#662933' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-662316</id><published>2000-08-18T08:17:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-18T08:17:13.936+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now i've messed up my sleep pattern again. i'd been having a good week; since i've had to get up early for training every day this week, i got a solid five or six hours each night. well, i was wiped out from training, so after i finished dinner around 7pm i laid down on my bed to read for a few minutes... soon the light was off and i was snoring. four hours later at eleven i woke up and decided to go to bed, so i got up to brush my teeth, undress, etc. and when i was back in bed i realized i wasn't tired anymore. i listened to the indigo girls for an hour and a half, and got up again. so, now it's 1am and the rest of the world is in bed or headed there, and i'm just getting up. it reminds me of when i worked nights during the summers years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one of the reasons i was so tired was the last day of training today. we finished this afternoon with an all-out drill which involved "level a"-suit entries into an area where a guy had gone down with a tank spraying boron trifluoride. i was on the decon (decontamination) team, but i had to bust my butt to get everything done in time because i was doing a ton of errands to get various people ready, setting up the perimeter of the zones and the decon area, and suiting up to do the actual decon hose-down. and the level b suits are very hot&amp;mdash;ever tried standing out in the sun on a warm day wearing a rubber suit from head to toe? i am now an official "hazwoper" (not be confused with an order at burger king). i think it's interesting and perhaps useful training to have, but on the other hand i never want to have to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i now have my very own copy of the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0788183990/ewallorg"&gt;2000 emergency response guidebook&lt;/a&gt;, which is a reference for identifying hazardous spills from various labels, deciding how to what to do and what not to do in response, including how far to evacuate the area and such. i think i'm going to put it in the car, so i can scare myself by looking up the numbers on the sides of tractor trailers and realizing just how dangerous a cargo they are carrying. also, i kind of suspect that the book might be good reading for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;remind me to call the maine revenue service tomorrow&amp;mdash;they can't figure out how to enter the data from the two w-2's i've sent them so far, so they are claiming that i owe them nearly four thousand dollars in taxes, when in fact they owe me over $700. i should have had the refund months ago, so once we finally straighten this out i'm going to ask for the interest i lost on the "loan" i've been giving them this year, which apparently there is some rule about. this is so frustrating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now i don't know what to do... i'm not the least been tired, and i'm also not nearly as frustrated as i was when i started writing this. i'm sure there's plenty of things i could be doing, but few i really want to right now. actually, i'd like to play my guitar a little, but i think my roommate and neighbors might have a problem with that at this hour. i really should write to some friends like i keep promising myself (and them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh, i forgot to mention: today is my last day with the goatee, sadly. one of the disadvantages of being on the ert at work is that i must be clean-shaven every day i'm there, so that the scba respirator mask will fit correctly. i'm doing the fit test first thing in the morning, so the goatee that i was really liking has got to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/647309'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/647309'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#647309' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-647244</id><published>2000-08-16T05:00:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-16T05:00:32.670+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;started my "emergency response team" training at work today. by thursday i'll be a certified private-sector hazardous materials emergency responder, technician level. that means i'll be qualified to be one of those idiots in the airtight chem suits who walk right into the middle of deathly chemical spills; or i could even be the "incident coordinator" managing the emergency containment efforts, in the absense of a more qualified individual (of which there are plenty). wow, even i'm impressed. 

&lt;p&gt;btw, my company is paying for it. and they're giving me a raise to do it. and it's a lot of fun. not a bad deal, eh? i'm sure these skills might come in handy some day; you never know when a trainload of nuclear waste is going to wreck in your back yard and you'll have to figure out if your legs will fall off if you wade through the toxic sludge to save fido&amp;mdash;but now i have my very own copy of the &lt;a href="http://hazmat.dot.gov/gydebook.htm"&gt;emergency response guidebook&lt;/a&gt; to tell me what to do. crimey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;trina stopped by to say hello about 5:15 as i was heading out the door, so we ended up chatting in the partking lot for another 45 minutes. finally, frank (a guy with a big mouth) drove by and said something like, "go home, eric&amp;mdash;people are starting to wonder!" sheesh. last week when trina was visiting in my cube, someone paged me asking if we were "an item." we got a good laugh out of that, and then i sent an alpha page reply to both of the people i suspected might have sent the message. so, one of those people received a page with this unintelligible statement "no. long story. nevermind.", and the other is probably waiting to hear the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it used to really bother me when people would tease me because they suspected i was involved with someone, but over the last couple years it's lost all effect on me, and i couldn't care less. you see, ever since we worked out the stuff about having no intention of dating, it's been really easy just to be friends. and now she's leaving in only a few days, heading back to college. oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night i finally installed and started playing the lucasarts game &lt;a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/products/grim/default.htm"&gt;grim fandango&lt;/a&gt;. i picked up the demo about two years ago when the game was released, and laughed through the entire thing. i bought the game a few months later, but never got around to playing it. in fact, i hadn't played a computer game since the fall of 1999, when i finally started again this weekend. anyway, i completed "year one" last night, and hopefully i'll complete "year two" tonight before i hit the sack. hopefully this one won't take too long, otherwise it'll lose my attention and probably never get it back. that happened with &lt;a href="http://www.interplay.com/fallout2/index.html"&gt;fallout 2&lt;/a&gt;for me&amp;mdash;it's a great game, and i really liked how it was so much bigger than the original &lt;a href="http://www.interplay.com/fallout/index.html"&gt;fallout&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps they made it a little too long. of course, now i'm interested in &lt;a href="http://www.interplay.com"&gt;interplay's&lt;/a&gt; new squad-based &lt;a href="http://www.interplay.com/falloutbos/index.html"&gt;fallout: brotherhood of steel&lt;/a&gt;, which is still in development with no published due-date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i did decide to go for the omelet at the bayou kitchen this morning, although it meant missing sunday school. since it was so crowded, i sat at the counter, right behind the grill. for most of the hour i was there i watched in amazement the woman in the train conductor's cap who keeps the whole place running. while juggling half a dozen items on the grill, she's also hollering out commands to the prep cook and the waitresses, including her own mother. i am in awe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at 5:30, troy called from camden to say he's staying there another night, and therefore i'd have to lead the bible study/fellowship group ("syzygus," after the greek word for "yokefellows") tonight. no time to prepare; no ideas on how to start the conversation. but somehow it worked out all right&amp;mdash;we connected with last week's discussion, and moved out of there with some questions and some real-life application, which is what the group is really about. so, i was pleased, and am thanking god for how he's growing us in that group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uh-oh... kim gave me another book to read, which comes highly recommended: daniel taylor's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0830822372/ewallorg"&gt;the myth of certainty&lt;/a&gt;. according to the jacket, it is "a book for reflective christians&amp;mdash;those caught in the tension between secular thought and christian faith.... [The author] suggests a path of commitment that is both consistent with the tradition of christian orthodoxy and sensitive to the complexity of our age." should prove to be interesting (i'll keep you posted). however, i must resist the urge to start it tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the cambridge singers under john rutter &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/ddcn=SD-8090+109+2"&gt;faur&amp;eacute;'s requiem&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; for choral music, john rutter's cambridge singers top my list. i didn't know faur&amp;eacute; (or at least take note of him) until my roommate picked up this cd, since he had performed "requiem" a number of years ago... but i distinctly remember a night soon after he bought it when he made several of us sit in the living room with all the lights out and listen to this sweet music. i'm hooked now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i was going to hit the trails with the mountain bike today, but i just couldn't get up the energy&amp;mdash;i have the usual splitting headache, and i'm just so wiped from overworking. i guess this next week should be easier, since i'll be sort of out of the office until friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've spent a good part of this evening cleaning up the computer. i did some data backups (and probably should do some system backups using &lt;a href="http://www.ghost.com"&gt;norton ghost&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow). i installed the new &lt;a href="http://www.umax.com/scanners/standard/products/astra3400.cfm"&gt;umax 3400 usb scanner&lt;/a&gt;; it's quite happy in win2k. i also did some major filesystem cleaning, including deleting the &lt;a href="http://www.redhat.com"&gt;linux&lt;/a&gt; and nt server partitions (i'm sure they'll be back) and consolidating some freespace to make one nice 10 gig partition. btw, win2k's disk management tools are a heck of a lot faster than &lt;a href="http://www.partitionmagic.com/partitionmagic/index.html"&gt;partition magic 5.0&lt;/a&gt;, which i've been generally happy with before, but tonight it wouldn't let me delete an extended partition, but win2k did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i suppose i should go to bed; i was planning on getting up early tomorrow so i could have breakfast at the bayou kitchen before i go to church. oh well... i suppose i could stay here and have a healthy&amp;mdash;if rushed&amp;mdash;breakfast instead. at least jody downstairs isn't having a party right now, like she usually does when she comes home drunk after the bars close on saturday nights&amp;mdash;her new roommate liz is home now, and i get the impression that liz is not the party type; so, at least it's quiet enough to go to sleep, if i decide to. oh yeah, there's laundry in the dryer, too... better get that before it wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;saw the movie &lt;a href="http://www.sunshinemovie.com/"&gt;sunshine&lt;/a&gt; at the keystone with my friend ray (conincidentally, actually). the movie was okay; i wouldn't necessarily recommend it, though. it was too wide&amp;mdash;not the screen, but rather the sprawl of time and characters all trying to give you a sense of deja vu that should lead to some sense of theme... sadly, it was too unfocused (again, not the screen) to actually try to make a point out to the two chosen themes (power and lust). too bad, it could've been so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the chat with ray afterwards was much more interesting... we just kind of hung around by my car, right there on congress street, while all the cars drove by. a red sports car full of teenage girls drove by twice, and each time they waved at us&amp;mdash;seeing that i'm 25 and ray is 41 (both past the point where we should be attractive to high school girls), we were flattered. the kids who drove by and threw the pennies were not so flattering, however. anyway, we got to talking about my new goal of not talking to women anymore and how well that is working out for me (so i maybe had to lie a little); ray seemed to like the idea. maybe i should start a support group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but i can't start that support group right now, because i really need to get started on my real money-maker entrepreneureal idea: i want to start a 900-number company called "the psychotic friends network." me and a number of my friends would be able to man the phones (or "woman the phones," i suppose), because we could qualify as psychotic. the gold mine is that we'll target this service to the rich people who have property around martha's vineyard and live perfect lives&amp;mdash;each day they could call up their psychotic friend to get the day's dose of weirdness, and then when they (the rich customers) are at parties later on in the afternoon, they can feel better about themselves by making fun of the charity-case proletariat pschos: "oh, you'd never guess what stupid idea my pschotic friend has got into this head now!" imagine... i could make a lot of money with this, i'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;

[editor's note: the people responsible for that pun have been sacked. we now continue this blob with a better writer.] no, i mean i never really connecting with his style of singing and playing&amp;mdash;too repetative and droning, in general. but this album of cover tunes brought out the songs and the lyrics for me. there are some solid tunes here put together by michael been, pierce pettis, victoria williams, randy stonehill... these aren't necessarily artists i would have picked, but they each add a good element to the mix. two songs that are not to be missed, however, are buddy &amp;amp; julie miller's "orphans of god" and bruce cockburn's definitive cover of "strong hand of love."&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/618639'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/618639'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#618639' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-610540</id><published>2000-08-10T04:30:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-10T04:30:08.500+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, this is annoying. it's 9:30pm, and i'm back at work so i can field an international conference call with &lt;a href="http://www.tsmc.com"&gt;tsmc&lt;/a&gt; as the official is/security representative for &lt;a href="http://www.national.com"&gt;national/south portland&lt;/a&gt;. nothing exciting, just deciding how to transfer some &lt;a href="http://www.pgp.com"&gt;pgp&lt;/a&gt;-encyrpted documents. i skipped going to prison and came back to work for this?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ani difranco's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1223783"&gt;swing set ep&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; just got this in today, and am enjoying it. as you might have guessed from the title, it's an ep of random things, some of which include versions of the song "swing" from the &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=800881"&gt;to the teeth&lt;/a&gt; album and a couple of cover tunes. nicely done, definitely an ep kind of feeling, not like a whole album... but not bad for eight bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the beautiful south &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=178235"&gt;welcome to the beautiful south&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; i mentioned this album in this weblog the other day, missing it because i only have a copy on cassette and rarely use the tape player anymore&amp;mdash;so the next time that &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com"&gt;cdnow&lt;/a&gt; offered me a sale, i went out and bought it. i'm glad, too... it arrived in perfect time last night. (of course, the songs have been stuck in my head all morning.) oh, i suppose i should tell you what kind of music it is, right? well, you know that style of really tight, clean, pretty british pop? well, take that musical style and put very, very bitter lyrics over it, and you have the beautiful south. topics include love and hate (but more of the latter), dysfunctional relationships, death in various forms (including suicide and murder), psychology and sociology, and perhaps worst of all: politics. if you can play piano, i'd recommend finding and learning the chords to "song for whoever" or "i'll sail this ship alone" so you can play these songs to impress you girlfriend (or depress her, as the case may be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, i've got half an hour before an &lt;a href="http://www.iss.net/webinars/"&gt;iss webinar&lt;/a&gt; on real-world computer security, which should prove to be interesting, then i've got lots of people to talk with today. but first i want to tell you about yesterday... because i like to whine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one of my coworkers, aaron, often must be scolded by our boss (alan) for his lack of "bedside manners," so to speak. ("computer-side manners?" "customer-side manners?" whatever!) yesterday, i was sitting in aaron's cube and alan had to give me the talk, because i had misdirected agression at someone who was pestering me, which caused him to go to the bosses and blame our group for not doing proper server backups. aaron was pleased at how i'm learning to be a jerk; i told him "i learned it from watching you!" (if you grew up in the 80's, you'd know that joke.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i finally escaped work and made it home (with some chinese food) around 7:30pm, only to find out that dawna was coming over to record some of her music at 8. ugh. it was like 90 degrees and humid, and we had to sit in troy's room with the fans off so the microphones wouldn't pick up the humming. and we sat there for nearly three hours, laid down very little track, and were all tired and annoyed with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then, of course, both troy and i realized it was too hot and we were too tired to actually get some sleep, so at least we had some time to chat, which can be rare sometimes. eventually, he started to get tired so he went off to bed, and i found the beautiful south cd in the pile of the day's mail, put it in the little cd player in my room, and dozed off to the perfectly bitter sounds of southern england, glad that the day was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;remind me to take the video tape back after prison tonight, or i'll have to pay yet another late fee. why can't they just pick up the tapes at your house? maybe divx wasn't such a bad idea.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'd forgotten how much i like &lt;a href="http://www.ally-mcbeal.com/frameset.html"&gt;ally mcbeal&lt;/a&gt;. yeah, i admit it: i'm a sap for this show. and i might just be a little taken with calista and her character, which is almost a first (okay, i guess i was in love with winnie from &lt;a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kpearce/wy.html"&gt;the wonder years&lt;/a&gt;). but more than that, i think david kelly is an excellent writer who knows the connection between the serious and the comic just as well as the Bard ever did. i'd forgotten, becauase i hadn't seen the show much at all over the past two years, and the few that i had seen this year were not particularly insipring. tonight's episode, though, was one of the fun ones&amp;mdash;you know, when barry white comes to sing for john's birthday?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;did i ever tell you about my mysterious conneciton with barry white? no, he's not a distant relative or anything, but for some reason his name is repeatedly brought to my attention. you know how cdnow sometimes recommends albums by particular artists, based on past purchases you've made? well, for months and months, every time i logged into cdnow it told me that i need to buy a barry white album. okay, sure... i fail to find even the smallest&amp;mdash;if any&amp;mdash;resemblance between his music and the dics i've bought from cdnow! such a mystery... i might just give in a buy one, just to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday i started into a new novel, salman rushdie's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805053085/ewallorg"&gt;the ground beneath her feet&lt;/a&gt;. i'm speechless&amp;mdash;it only took to the end of chapter one (which serves as the introduction), and i am completely hooked. it's almost surprising to find such a good writer these days&amp;mdash;i don't expect much out of the contemporary best seller's list, with the exception of a very few (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/Author=Cisneros%2C%20Sandra"&gt;sandra cisneros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/Author=Erdrich%2C%20Louise"&gt;louise erdrich&lt;/a&gt;, for example). i haven't had the time to read very far yet, but i'll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;btw, for you christians who may be worried to hear that i'm reading a book from the author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805053093/ewallorg"&gt;the satanic verses&lt;/a&gt;, you should think again. i will admit that i have not read it yet, but perhaps i will someday (this kind of attitude no doubt earned the book it's position as "the most famous book people will never read"). however, what i have gathered from several who have read the book is that there is little in it (besides the title) that would offend a christian. it's characters, plot and perhaps even themes are parodies of the islamic scriptures, the qu'ran&amp;mdash;it is the muslims who put the price on their countryman's head who were offended. maybe they are right in being offended; however, it begs the question: why do they need to defend their god(s)? i don't think my god really needs my protection&amp;mdash;he's big enough to handle himself without my help. i might not like it when someone blasphemes my god, but ultimately it's not my problem to deal with&amp;mdash;so i don't need to take any vengeance in my own hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;note to self: must check out &lt;a href="http://www.rim.org/muslim/islam.htm"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; sometime for some potentially interesting reading on christianity and islam.&lt;/p&gt;

(unfortunately, i'm not sure i can say the same for vonda's newest release, &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=651163"&gt;by 7:30&lt;/a&gt;, which is not nearly so good.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/598187'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/598187'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#598187' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-585159</id><published>2000-08-05T22:41:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-05T22:41:31.920+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so i'm finally getting down to putting this whole website thing together, at least in a reasonable, publishable albeit temporary form. my problem is self-criticism&amp;mdash;i'm too picky to let myself publish a site that doesn't look perfect from the start. but i've been learning to supress my obsessive-compulsive tendencies (like writing in pencil and using the eraser to fix every little imperfect letter), so i can learn to do this too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've tossed around ideas for what i'd like to use for the backbone of my component-based content-managed super-dynamic website, and i think i've finally decided: i'm going to add &lt;a href="http://www.masonhq.com"&gt;html::mason&lt;/a&gt; to the already-planned &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/httpd.html"&gt;apache server&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://perl.apache.org/"&gt;mod_perl&lt;/a&gt;. that should give me plenty of fast-and-simple solutions while still satisfying the needs for flexibility and wizardry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of course, my new web server is nowhere near ready. i ordered &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1571762469/ewallorg"&gt;the complete freebsd&lt;/a&gt; to help me with the server setup, since there are enough differences between freebsd and the srv4-based unixes like solaris and linux that i'm more accustomed to. plus, i'm really going to need to work on locking down the server security, so i'm going to need to know it inside-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the verve's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=443340"&gt;urban hymns&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; the first two songs on this disc are definitely the best stick-in-your-head tunes that will have you humming it all day, especially "sonnet." you may find some of the rhythmic background stuff, like the strings in "bitter sweet symphony," to be a bit on the repetative-annoying side, but just deal with it. (btw, don't confuse these guys ("the verve") with the one-hit wonders "the verve pipe." although "freshmen" was a good song, the rest of their music has never done much for me, at least.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/585159'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/585159'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#585159' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-582849</id><published>2000-08-05T07:41:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-05T07:41:02.700+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hey! i survived another d.t.r. with both arms and both legs! (a d.t.r., if you were unaware, is the dreaded "defining the relationship" talk. you know exactly what i mean.) yeah, so tonight was the dreaded night out with trina, and we both knew it was coming; in fact, we'd even suggested that it would have to come tonight. and so it turns out everything's cool&amp;mdash;she's interested in another guy, and i'm not interested in dating anyone. it couldn't have worked out any better. as soon as we explained our individual sides of the story, the tension was cut like the humidy that disappears right after the rain, and we can be friends without worrying about it, and without having to say those cursed words "let's just be friends."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wow, with luck like this, i just might even start talking to women again... soon. yeah, sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after trina took off (she had to drive to worchester tonight), i rented the video of &lt;a href="http://www.truman-show.com/"&gt;the truman show&lt;/a&gt;, since i knew my roommate wouldn't be home. he keeps on telling me that he didn't like the movie at all, and i keep telling him that i think the idea was brilliant and that whether or not they were successful, there is the potential to make a statement through this plot. well, i have to disagree with troy, because i thought the film was very well done. predictable&amp;mdash;yes, perhaps&amp;mdash;but pointed nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/582849'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/582849'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#582849' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-575694</id><published>2000-08-04T02:43:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-04T02:43:05.373+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:30pm and i'm still at work... but&amp;mdash;i'm in geek heaven today! i got the shipment of books for our group, which included two &lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com"&gt;o'reilly&lt;/a&gt; books for me: the old standby (which i had never happened to buy before) &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565921275/ewallorg"&gt;essential system administration&lt;/a&gt; and a brand-spankin' new one called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565926099/ewallorg"&gt;perl for system administration&lt;/a&gt;. the new perl book is awesome, exactly what i'm needing right now. it's full of tips for writing cross-platform code to analyse and modify file systems, user accounts, tcp/ip settings, etc. it's also got appendices with concise introductions to management tools such as snmp and ldap&amp;mdash;the best summaries i've seen of these concepts so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm starting to work on a big project which involves collecting all kinds of inventory, performance and availability data from mulitple os'es (namely, solaris, nt and vms) and reporting on it in flexible formats (web, most likely). i'm still deciding how much of third-party utilities to use and how much to build myself with perl... but this book is making me learn towards the latter option. how fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, i've spent this afternoon rebuilding and reconfiguring my sparc workstations: one for work (named 'keegan' after a town way up in northern maine) and one for home (name 'tuvoc' because he'll guard the security of my home network). i probably ought to think about eating and going home sometime soon, but i'm having too much fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know, back when i was in college (as an english-ed major, no less!), i was embarrassed by my potential geekiness, and never allowed anyone to call me a computer geek... even thought i lived with, hung around with, and even programmed with a bunch of comp-sci majors. now i guess i have to admit it... i work with computers all day. i drive the ten minutes back to my house, and flip on the computer. i'm definitely a computer geek now, i confess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i can quit any time i want to, really.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/575694'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/575694'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#575694' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-572623</id><published>2000-08-03T17:21:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-03T17:21:18.326+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i keep forgetting to tell you about this&amp;mdash;it's for computer geeks only, so if you don't consider yourself a geek you probably won't find this in the least bit interesting, so go away. tom sent me this link the other day, which had me rolling on the floor: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670672238/ewallorg"&gt;the story about ping&lt;/a&gt;. you must scroll down and read the reviews before you continue reading my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i sent the link on to tyler, and soon after came his response:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;well i found the review helpful. it would be so easy to explain the utility to little children or upper management using a book like that. i hope they carry on the series. i would love see more stories about common unix utilities...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;cron the town crier
&lt;li&gt;top the optimist
&lt;li&gt;grep the hound
&lt;li&gt;chown the lawyer
&lt;li&gt;rm the hunter
&lt;li&gt;ls the librarian
&lt;li&gt;du and ps the accountant brothers.
&lt;li&gt;touch the revisionist historian (academic press only)
&lt;li&gt;the less and more sisters
&lt;li&gt;perl the wiley old wizard. (the son of  awk and ed utility)
&lt;li&gt;c the blacksmith, and his son c++
&lt;li&gt;java, c's bastard son (adult audience only&amp;mdash;an intriguing tale or hopes dreams trials failures and large faceless corporations that will steal you away)
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a few weeks ago i purchased o'reilly's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565921526/ewallorg"&gt;learning gnu emacs&lt;/a&gt; on sale, because i detest vi, i can never find &lt;a href="http://www.go.dlr.de/cgi-bin/man?joe"&gt;joe&lt;/a&gt; on other people's systems, so i'm starting to get into emacs. so today i unburied it from the stacks at home, and brought it into work, and now i have no room on the bookshelf to put it. sheesh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; the smiths' &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=324231"&gt;vol. 1&amp;mdash;best of the smiths&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; when i lived in germany, i made a cassette i affectionately called my "bitter brits" tape, which had on one side this album, and &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=178235"&gt;welcome to the beautiful south&lt;/a&gt; on the other. what a great pair&amp;mdash;such bitter lyrics paired with happy beats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;how can you stay with a fat girl who says, "oh...&lt;br&gt;
would you like to marry me?&lt;br&gt;
and if you like you can buy the ring"
she doesn't care about anyone.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align="center" bgcolor="#EBEBEB" class="title"&gt;that's just what you are&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="right" class="posted"&gt;posted &lt;$BlogItemDateTime$&gt; |
&lt;a href="&lt;$BlogItemArchiveFileName$&gt;#&lt;$BlogItemNumber$&gt;"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;following some random blogs link-by-link (you know how browsing can lead you strange places)&amp;mash;i found this book: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452270863/ewallorg"&gt;how to attract anyone, anytime, anyplace: the smart guide to flirting&lt;/a&gt;. oh boy, here it comes&amp;mdash;i've been trying to avoid writing in the weblog about this, but here goes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh, but first, a message from our previous messages: remember the other day i went off on the whole "don't touch her!!!" idea? well, susan rabin, the author of this and several other self-help books about love and flirting, summed it up quite nicely: "touch is a powerful communicator. use it sparingly." (i could've said it better myself, but i chose not to.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now back to our rant...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm giving up talking to girls (er, "women"). really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you know me already and you're reading this, you don't believe me. if i were reading this, i wouldn't believe me either. but it's true. really. really-really. i mean it this time. of course, i can still talk with kim (who's married) and maegan (who's taken) and my mom (no comment, mr. freud) and, well, whoever... just not&amp;mdash;you know&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;girls&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yes, i'm 25 years old and still single, mainly because i'm so damn picky. i'm a fairly attractive guy, outgoing and easy to talk to, everybody's friend. i have a darn good job, for someone with a degree in teaching english. sure, seven months ago the girl everyone thought i'd marry broke up with me (no pity, please), but i've dealt with that fine, right? i think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my problem with talking with eligible women is that, well, they don't want to be eligible anymore, and often they want me to change that status for them. maybe you're thinking: why is he complaining about this? never fear, i'll tell you: i'm a nice guy. 99.99% of the time i'm not really interested, and if she suddenly becomes interested, i have to figure out a way to let her down easy. that, my friends, is a challenge each and every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;enough said.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/570478'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/570478'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#570478' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-570080</id><published>2000-08-03T05:17:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-03T05:17:03.543+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i just put the guitar down after playing about 45 minutes, and remembered that i'm supposed to sing in church this sunday and accompany myself on the guitar. since this will be the first time i've actually played the little acoustic with all eyes on me, i guess i'm a little nervous. of course, the worry doesn't mean that i've actually practiced the song enough yet! as my writing teacher in college used to say, "i believe deadlines are inspirational." maybe i'll come up with something crazy and new at the last minute (aka a "mistake")... just think of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so, since i'm on this reading kick and i just finished &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140286411/ewallorg"&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;, i'm back to the one i started a while back, tom robbins' &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553348981/ewallorg"&gt;jitterbug perfume&lt;/a&gt;. it is perhaps one of the strangest books i've read in a while, and it took me a little while to warm up to it. at about a third of the way through, i finally understand for certain the real connection between the various characters in different times and places, so at least that much is making some connection. nonetheless, a book with a real focus on smells and&amp;mdash;er, beets&amp;mdash;is unique to me. but, so far it's worthwhile. i just shouldn't read it before i go to bed, or i'll have some wacked-out dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;speaking of dreams, i'd recommend against installing freebsd just before you go to sleep. all night and all morning (i tried to sleep in, rather unsuccessfully) i was dreaming about lists of software with ten-digit version numbers and complicated sql statements. once i get an idea into my head, it just bounces around for hours and never escapes. no wonder i'm an insomniac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but not tonight, no insomnia for me. i'm going to go to bed soon (maybe after reading a bit of the book), and i'm going to sleep straight through until morning (say, three am?). it's gotta be tonight&amp;mdash;if i'm going to do any more productive work the next couple of days, i'm going to have to get some sleep first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ug, i've got to talk with syloke tomorrow. i set a goal that i'd have the current and planned web services mapped out for my boss by the end of the week, and it's nearing friday. i need to gleen a quantity of information from syloke, who can be quite a talker. (yeah, i'm one to point fingers, i know...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here's a little hint: if during your installation of &lt;a href="http://www.freebsd.org/"&gt;freebsd 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, it freezes during a package install&amp;mdash;don't press &amp;lt;ctrl-c&amp;gt; unless you really, really wanted to start the whole process over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i finally opened up the cheapie &lt;a href="http://athome.compaq.com/MiddleFrame.ASP?Page=ShowRoom&amp;Tab=0&amp;CompPart=189713-003&amp;AppID=18930&amp;PriceLevelID=18930&amp;SuperCategoryId=&amp;ProductLineId=441&amp;FamilyId=668&amp;BaseId=2116&amp;cpqsid=9SVPNF63D0S92H0W00A3HBC3TR986WCA"&gt;compaq presario 7594&lt;/a&gt; that i bought to be an apache web server. i didn't have any room left in my "office" area&amp;mdash;although now i have more floor space since leslie took back her big keyboard, i can't find a suitable table to put in that spot as a temporary pc build platform&amp;mdash;so i had to set it up on the living room coffee table. i had another motive for putting it out there anyway, because i wanted to watch &lt;a href="http://www.dilberttv.com/"&gt;dilbert&lt;/a&gt; and (i confess) &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?%22Secret+Agent+Man%22"&gt;secret agent man&lt;/a&gt; because i'm so rarely home during primetime. i never did find "secret agent man," but i'm probably the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;still working on that freebsd install... i wonder if it will finish soon, so i can get that pc out of the living room and go to bed. sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/564515'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/564515'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#564515' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-560732</id><published>2000-08-01T18:54:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-08-01T18:54:11.123+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i had planned at least three hours to do a netobjects server installation today, because leeann had warned me that the documentation said you'd have to have a consultant come and do the install because they don't provide all the information you need and so on. as it turns out, they decided not to do the complicated stuff with ibm websphere server integration (phew!), so the whole process took under an hour. of course, now leeann has to figure out how to configure it, which is certainly the harder part. (lucky me&amp;mdash;i only have to support the server and make sure it keeps working, which is the easy part.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm supposed to be joining the "emergency response team" (or ert) at work, and i've got all the appropriate approval from my boss(es), i have all the prerequisite training and preparation, and the nurse has given me the full run-over for it (including taking some blood, and a lung capacity test!). so now i'm waiting for someone to tell me what i need to do for training, since they're doing a bunch of the courses this month that i think will qualify&amp;mdash;but no one is really saying exactly what's next. arrrgh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;forgot to mention: &lt;a href="http://www.stormwerks.com/linked/"&gt;/usr/bin/girl&lt;/a&gt; linked &lt;a href="http://www.escriptz.cjb.net/"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; with transcripts of various movies (and tv shows). i found a few that i wanted to have on hand, so i'm happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, i think i have some sort of tumor or cyst or something. a sore spot that i thought was a bruise that was taking way too long to heal has finally decided to harden into a lump. so now i have this weird little lump on my forearm. will need to chat with a doctor about this one, i think. (that last incident&amp;mdash;you know, with the pocket knife&amp;mdash;just didn't work out right...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh, and by the way&amp;mdash;&lt;a href="http://www.fourohfour.net/"&gt;zannah and james&lt;/a&gt;, congrats on the marriage. glad to hear that your shuttle launched successfully. have a happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wow, i made it a whole weekend without logging onto any computer, or checking email, or writing in my weblog. of course, i did try to use the cell phone far too many times, seeing that there's no cell service in indian lake, new york. but at least i was able to call for my voice mail and travel pager messages, so i didn't have too much techno-connectedness withdrawal. (perhaps we need a tla for that&amp;mdash;tcw? is anyone with me?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and i had a good excuse: a wedding (not mine!). saturday afternoon we successfully married off my friend andrew, despite the rain. i was not in the wedding party, but i called myself "the official chauffeur of the miller-whalen groomsmen." and i got to be mc (emcee?) at the reception, a position which i'm particularly qualified for because i'm such a ham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ever since his sister's wedding, tyler has not stopped making comparisons between the way women prepare for a wedding and the only time men have ever put that much work into a single event: the moon landing. well, another eagle has landed, and the couple are flying off to some uncharted territory to begin an altogether different adventure. god bless them for it, they have more guts than i do. i don't even talk to women anymore, because it gets me in too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;meanwhile, eric (that's me) has decided that not only should he never talk with women, but he shouldn't even look at them. he caught himself on more than one occasion making eyes at one particular young woman who didn't seem to mind one bit, but nonetheless was apparently associated with one particular other young man at the event. oops. oh, and that particular young man drove his van well into a ditch (remember that it was raining, and know that it was an outdoor reception under a little canopy-type-thing at a park), making a complete fool of himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh yeah, speaking of trouble: on the way home i stopped at the local &lt;a href="http://www.hannaford.com/"&gt;slop 'n slave&lt;/a&gt; for a few essentials, and ended up meeting this girl, a friend of a former co-worker/friend, who i met in a bar a month or so ago. she wanted to talk; i didn't. we ended up talking. (troy tells me i should just try farting really loudly in the middle of the conversation without even acknowledging the interruption, in an attempt to gross her out... an obvious adaptation of the tried-and-true technique of &lt;a href="http://tvtp.simplenet.com/pick.htm"&gt;the pick&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of seinfeld.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my poor little escort &lt;a href="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Benny%20&amp;%20Joon%20(1993)"&gt;joon&lt;/a&gt; added another 900 miles to her little whiny speedometer. (really, the speedometer whines, and no one can figure out how to fix it short of replacing the entire insturment console.) three-hundred fifty miles to lake george, and then several 50-mile trips to "the hamlet of indian lake" (hamlet? what's a hamlet? i'm not making this up!) with a carload of people, and 350 miles home. i was going to take a nice slow scenic route home, cutting through vermont and new hampshire, but since the sky was leaking and the clouds weren't letting the sun peak through a bit, i opted for the fast lane home, minus an hour's nap at a rest stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;last night, despite the fact that i was completely wiped from the weekend, i had to finish reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140286411/ewallorg"&gt;44: dublin made me&lt;/a&gt;. wow, i'm glad i picked up that book&amp;mdash;it's such a great snapshot of life, which is exactly the kind of book i connect with. this was so interesting, i really plowed through it pretty fast, seeing how busy i've been lately. now i have to decide which to start next: j.m. coetzee's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670887315/ewallorg"&gt;disgrace&lt;/a&gt; or salman rushdie's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805053085/ewallorg"&gt;the ground beneath her feet&lt;/a&gt; (the book which inspired bono while working on &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1163899"&gt;million dollar hotel&lt;/a&gt;)? i picked up both of these at the same time that i got 44, and now i have decide again who's next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; aimee mann's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=818135"&gt;magnolia (soundtrack)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; despite the supertramp and gabrielle tracks, this album is a great package, even if you already have aimee's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=1183677"&gt;bachelor no. 2&lt;/a&gt;, which has some of the same songs. plus, it reminds me of the &lt;a href="http://www.magnoliamovie.com"&gt;movie&lt;/a&gt;, which simply defined the art of using the medium of film to it's full advantage. p.t. anderson was inspired by aimee's music (read the liner notes), and it shows (watch the movie).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for your reading pleasure: an inpromptu poem, inspired by a list of words i had copied into microsoft word to take advantage of the spellcheck feature unavailable at &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/"&gt;blogger.com&lt;/a&gt;. enjoy.

&lt;p&gt;no company picnic for me&amp;mdash;it's raining anyway, so who'd want to go sit under a tent with a bunch of soggy, craggy people that you work with everyday? well, some people did, but i couldn't because i was still finishing the barcode project. i gave greg my dinner ticket, and soon i'm really going to be wishing i was having that steak over whatever fast food joint i find on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but the good news is that i finished the barcode program and accompanying documentation, or at least i finished as much as i need to now. roland will pick up the packet and the barcode gun tomorrow, and they'll try it out next week. i figure next week i'll be able to make whatever changes they want, do a workaround for the "replace" function that eagle says is "to be avoided," and spruce up the documentation. maybe i'll close on the project completely next friday&amp;mdash;wouldn't that be nice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just picked up &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565924193/ewallorg"&gt;cgi programming with perl, 2nd ed.&lt;/a&gt; cheap. i figured since i'm starting to do so much more interactive web development and database interaction, i might as well break down and buy the bible for cgi.pm. i may be just geeky enough to take it with me this weekend, in case i have a spare minute in the hotel.

&lt;p&gt;all right, it's past nine and i haven't had anything for dinner yet, so i'm going to lock up and go home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at work this afternoon, i finally got in touch with roland in maryland so he could make some decisions so i could continue writing the stupid barcoder program. after getting back from a great night at the prison, i sat right down again at the computer to work on it, and i think it'll be fine. dang, it better be, because i want to go to the company picnic tomorrow night, instead of working on this project, and then i want to go home and get ready to leave first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;remind me never to take any more "easy" contracts writing software for barcode scanners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i suppose i should go to bed soon, but the ani cd is still playing, and i feel the need to browse the web. perhaps i'll hit my college website and check out the alumni postings... of course, every time i take a look there, i end up emailing half a dozen people that i haven't talked to in years&amp;mdash;so i may never get to sleep tonight. oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yentl: a movie about a young jewish girl (played by barbara streisand) who wants to go to yeshiva school, so she dresses as a boy, falls in love with her best friend (the marvelous mandy patankin) and marries his girlfriend so that he won't. got that? trina had never even heard of it. (kids these days...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was searching for a link to send trina to prove that a movie of that plot summary really exists, and i landed on this link: &lt;a href="http://www.sabren.com/rants/1999/05/19990530a.php3"&gt;"nice guy" done right&lt;/a&gt;. yes, this guy is actually making references/analogies to the movie "yentl"... but i'll forgive him for it, because it's a well thought-out article. and, of course, i have to comment on it... so please read it before continuing to read my further ramblings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in college, i had this friend marcie who was always interested in knowing when one of the guys in our dorm was going on a date (we had a small, tight dorm, with 64 girls and 32 guys, so we were all like brothers and sisters). this wasn't just because she was nosy but more importantly because she wanted to give us a message, shouted at the top of her quite adequate lungs: &lt;b&gt;"don't touch her!!!"&lt;/b&gt; her point, after explanation, was this: she wanted to give the young women of &lt;a href="http://www.tayloru.edu/"&gt;taylor university&lt;/a&gt; the opportunity to evaluate the young men they were dating based on the real merits of their interpersonal interaction and character, rather than having the girls' feelings short-circuited by the boys' physical contact. yes, guys, women are so sensitive to touch that it sends messages that you (we) can't imagine, so when there's a chance that she's attracted to you, your touch can make her head spin and even sometimes let her do things she wouldn't normally do... a short-circuit in her head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;honestly, i agree with marcie. avoid "hot-wiring" your vulnerable intended one with this little bit of dangerous knowledge. if you want to keep her (and not just use her) let her decide with all of her faculties intact that she wants you, and not just your touch. to reiterate: guys, don't try this at home&amp;mdash;take marcie's advice and don't touch her during those critical decision moments. if you can't, be careful man, you're playing with fire. fire, i tell you. enough said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ladies, feel free to react to my blatant overstatement of a generalization that you think you aren't susceptible to, if you are offended that i seem to suggest that women might possibly be predictable and comprehensible. i'm a reasonable guy, and would be happy to listen to you and argue your counterpoint.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/528295'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/528295'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#528295' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-526173</id><published>2000-07-25T23:41:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-25T23:41:50.496+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've been sitting here in my cube for the last hour, listening to this indian man give a presentation on "understanding ldap" from a microsoft technical training disk. i've got almost nothing out of it, partially because the demo videos are so small i can't read the words, and also because i've been doing other things on my computer instead of paying attention to the lesson. bonnie, the new engineer in our group, is sitting in the cube across from me&amp;mdash;i wonder if she thinks i'm listenting to this like a radio station. (a mellow voice comes over the airwaves: "you're listening to in-somnia ninety point-nine&amp;mdash;all boring lectures, all the time.") i give up! there's no well-written, practical survey of the ldap standards anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;johnny, my love, get out of the business&lt;/br&gt;
that's make me want to rough you up so badly&lt;br&gt;
makes me want to roll you up in plastic&lt;br&gt;
toss you up, and pump you full of lead&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've been singing this song in my head all day, from the morning shower until now, almost time to hit the sack. sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wow, i've spent all weekend worrying about how rough i thought this week was going to be, and even for a monday, it's already started off pretty darn good. i've completed a bunch of the little tasks i need to do&amp;mdash;including getting a haircut, buying a wedding present, finding directions to the albany airport, and doing a couple loads of laundry&amp;mdash;and a few tasks i didn't expect to do, including finding the dylan and the band cd's, and getting a new pair of dress slacks from &lt;a href="http://www.skmenswear.com/"&gt;s&amp;k&lt;/a&gt; (all the while muttering to myself "mens-wear" in a deep voice just like the gay guy on &lt;a href="http://ourworld-top.cs.com/aybsontheweb/aybs.htm"&gt;are you being served?&lt;/a&gt; answers the phone) . but that's just a start: more importantly, i solved the problem with the percon barcode scanner validation, which i was expecting to kill me this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, i got some great news in the mail today, which had me hooting. i've been eagerly awaiting my results from the microsoft mcp beta exam for &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/exams/examasearch.asp?PageID=70-220"&gt;designing windows 2000 security&lt;/a&gt;, because i figured i'd get a discount coupon for taking the real test, which as far as i know opened last week. finally the letter came today, and it said that not only did i do alright on the beta test, but i passed it, and they're giving me full credit for the real test. what a deal! i only read about 50 pages before taking it, because i didn't think it counted for anything, and because i only had two day's notice. and i passed&amp;mdash;what a riot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also, i got to watch &lt;a href="http://www.fox.com/ally/"&gt;ally&lt;/a&gt; tonight, and it had been a long time. i really didn't like most of the bits of this season that i'd seen, but this one was pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sorry if these sentences don't really make sense tonight. i tried. my brain is full.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/522021'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/522021'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#522021' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-519128</id><published>2000-07-24T20:26:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-24T20:26:35.076+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;oh boy, this is going to be a long week. i'm starting to count the hours until friday morning when i leave for the wedding (not my own) this weekend. (at least i already found the &lt;a href="http://www.albanyairport.com/"&gt;albany airport&lt;/a&gt;, where i'm picking up tyler on the way to lake george.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;got a free coupon for another "express lunch" at papa gino's, since it took them well over the "3-minute guarantee." of course, as far as i can remember, they've never had my lunch in my hands there within three minutes, so this is the first time they actually honored the guarantee. how exciting... i ought to eat there less often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;must call &lt;a href="http://www.percon.com/"&gt;percon&lt;/a&gt; tech support to figure out how to get the barcode scanner to validate scans off an uploaded file. if i can't get that to work by friday morning, i'm in deep doo-doo (yes, that's a technical term).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;okay, back to work...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what a fine weekend. i am relaxed and happy, ready (almost) to face what i expect to be a difficult week. why is god so good to me? i certainly don't deserve it. he puts people into my life that will love me unconditionally and help me anytime, and it seems i never appreciate them enough, but they're still there. okay, enough with the hallmark moment...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm definitely loving that &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140286411/ewallorg"&gt;44: dublin made me&lt;/a&gt; book: last night i made it through chapter five before sloughing off to sleep, and i got more in today while sitting down by the lake at the komulainen's camp, although i kept getting interrupted. (at one point, i had to apologize after being asked a question and having no idea what they were talking about&amp;mdash;i used the excuse that i was in ireland at the time, because i was so absorbed in the book.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i never did make it to work this morning, like i had intended; actually, i wasn't even out of bed until after noon. but i think it's all for the best&amp;mdash;i really needed a good rest and a relaxing weekend to prepare me for the upcoming crazy week. i had breakfast (brunch) at my favorite little greasy spoon (an apt title, really), called "the bayou kitchen." how a cajun joint like that ended up in portland, maine, i couldn't tell you; but i can tell you it's the best omelette in town. anyway, i brought along my roommate's copy of tom robbin's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553348981/ewallorg"&gt;jitterbug perfume&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the strangest books i've read in a while. to this point, as far as i can tell, the novel is about beets, and perfume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now, hours later, i'm at my parents house is tourist-packed camden, maine, and i'm reading a much better book. sure, i'll finish the robbins one&amp;mdash;it would make great insomnia reading, to ensure that when i finally do go to sleep i'll have really wacked-out dreams. anyway, today i got a few new books from my club (&lt;a href="http://www.qpb.com"&gt;quality paperback books&lt;/a&gt;), and the first one on my list (which i'm already three chapters into) is peter sheridan's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140286411/ewallorg"&gt;44: dublin made me&lt;/a&gt;, an autobiography as the title suggests. continuing my recent run of books about ireland, this is definitely fueling my desire to visit the green isle, as my old college roommate tyler and i are hoping to do in autumn. i'm even tempted to stop by 44 seville place to see what mr. sheridan's old neighborhood looks like today. anyway, i'm very impressed with the book so far, and will probably finish it very quickly. (depending on how much sleep i get tonight, i might take a big chunk out of it by morning!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i hope troy called our landlady; she wanted us to call tonight to set up a time to sing the lease for the next year, and she's so uptight that if we don't call her exactly when she wants, she'll get all in a tizzy about it next time we have to talk with her. such an intollerable woman. (i'm sure you'll soon hear more from me about her and her huband, so stay tuned.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; over the rhine's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=767137"&gt;amateur shortwave radio&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; if i was forced at gunpoint to name my favorite band of all time, i guess i'd have to say it is over the rhine. i think i've seen them perform live more times than any other band, and each time was memorable. this album is all live cuts from the past ten years, with good recording quality and excellent performances, some which improve drastically over the album cuts. this disc is so good, i often don't let myself sing over it (like i do with every other cd i own), lest i miss a single nuance of ric's guitar solo or karin's incredible voice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/512586'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/512586'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#512586' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-508929</id><published>2000-07-22T07:43:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-22T07:43:39.293+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i confess: i don't understand online chats. i've tried&amp;mdash;maybe not hard enough, but i have tried. sometimes i think it'd be worthwhile, but then i remember how many people i already know that i could be talking to instead. and of course, the only irc numbers i know are people from work, and what's the point of that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;perhaps i should go to bed. i have to go to work again tomorrow. but then again, is sleep really a requirement for work? i mean, i've survived the last few weeks&amp;mdash;heck, the last few years&amp;mdash;on "limited" sleep, and i still do "productive" work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;speaking of productivity at work, one of my coworkers says that, statistically speaking, most office workers have only an hour or two of productive time per day. his theory is that people like himself (and me) who get in a solid three or more hours per day of productive work will stay ahead of the success curve. okay, sure... whatever happened to work ethics? oh well. success is overrated; i could easily push to the front of the success curve (at age 25, i'm already a senior engineer at a fortune 100 company, and i didn't even try to end up here), but i don't need to. i think a good work ethic means that i feel good about the work i put in, and i am rewarded for it. or i could be full of hot air... and yet, statistically speaking, i'm full of hot water.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/508929'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/508929'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#508929' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-507069</id><published>2000-07-21T23:45:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-21T23:45:49.590+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;best buy... one of the midwest best and worst imports to new england. best buy is fairly new to portland, but quickly rose to the top by undercutting and overselling circut city. now everybody in greater portland thinks of best buy when they think of a/v and home electronics equipment. i'm not so sure if that's a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i spent lunch hour at best buy today, waiting to get the best buy on a little compaq celeron box that will be my new web server for ewall.org. you know, i'm six-foot-three and over 225 pounds, but according to their rules my back would immediately break if i tried to step on their ladder to pick my box off the top shelf; so i had to wait 45 minutes for some 18-year old kid to get it down for me, then i waited another 15 minutes at the register because he hadn't filled out the little slip for the package deal i was getting. sheesh. but hey, i have a new web server (and a spare monitor and a printer for my roommate) for $500, that is assuming that my company security is doing their job and no one has broken into my car as it has sat in the parking lot this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;speaking of my car, i think i'm going to go hop into it and drive home. maybe i'll get a chance to relax a few minutes before moving the electric piano then running off for dinner. then again, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/507069'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/507069'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#507069' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-504110</id><published>2000-07-21T11:30:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-21T11:30:29.326+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yes, i know it's four in the morning. i'm wide awake. around 11:30pm i went to sleep reclined in the living room comfy chair, intentionally. since i've been fighting the insomnia for a couple weeks, i'm really tired of (no pun intended) just about every possible sleeping position i can find in my bed, so a change of position in the recliner was just fine. anyway, about 3:30 i woke up and decided to move to my normal bed, which i did without much trouble... but then i wasn't tired anymore, not in the least. and then i made the mistake of thinking through some of the problems i'm having with several projects at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;work yesterday was fairly frustrating, as it left me with two unsolved problems. first, i was trying to configure the cpan module for a perl installation, but i couldn't get it to work through the ftp proxy, despite configuring it to use the proxy in both that module and the net::ftp module it depends on. secondly, i need to wrap up the barcode project for the maryland site by next friday, and i just finally got the new proteus inventory database software working, more or less. actually, i tried the barcode module commands on the new software last night, and it downloads from the barcoder unit just fine, says it can read the data alright, but then refuses to do anything with it. (the assumption in my doing this project was that the stupid inventory software would do all the data reconcilliation for me&amp;mdash;i don't want to write a custom interface to their custom database&amp;mdash;and that all i'd have to make is a better program for the barcoder unit.) so in work tomorrow (uh, today, in four or five hours) i will have to call the &lt;a href="http://www.eaglecmms.com"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt; tech support and ream them again, and see if i get any result. even once this is fixed, i still have one major technical hurdle on the barcoder program itself which i need to jump before next friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i missed last night's &lt;a href="http://www.mainerockgym.com"&gt;indoor rock climbing&lt;/a&gt; outing because i was at work. that's two in a row that i've missed, and i'm annoyed. but we've been going fairly regularly now for a couple months, so it's not like i won't have another chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was going to stay with my parents in camden all weekend, and they were really excited because it's been a while since i've been able to have a longer visit with them. but now it turns out i can't go until saturday night, because after work today my ex-father-in-law-to-be (got that?) will be coming by to pick up my ex's full-size keyboard (i'll be keyless until i buy one myself!), then saturday morning i should probably work on the damn barcode project, and then saturday evening i'm the only one with a key to the church who can let people in for the deaf ministry prayer meeting, for which only one person is expected to show up. i guess i'll just have the car packed to leave immediately after the prayer meeting either finishes or doesn't start for lack of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my stomach seems to be settling with the two extra-strength tums i took before i started writing. i wonder if the rest of my body is ready to go back to sleep, or if i should just stay up now and have a really productive morning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i've got that song in my head (r.e.m.'s "the one i love") because i was just telling my roommate troy that lisa and james have that single on vinyl, sitting on top of the record stack in their apartment. i'm so jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;speaking of jealousy, i'm assuming dawna has left for nova scotia by now (she never told me exactly what day she was planning on leaving), because i didn't get an email from her today, which is unusual (don't tell her i said that). jealous, jealous, jealous...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you're even in portland, maine: make sure you stop at "the great lost bear" restaurant for some good eats (there's nothing on the menu that's not good) and good bear (all the best on tap). imho, there really aren't that many places in portland with "character", but this one does qualify. so, tonight as we were driving back from the prison (yes, the prison), troy called his s.o. to meet us at the bear for dinner, which she did, and now we are all full and happy and tired. and did i mention that the food is good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;have you seen the movie "office space"? well, i was inspried by that movie, in particular the scene where he tells jennifer anniston (that was her character name in the movie, right?) that he's not going to work the next day, and she assumes he's been fired, and he just doesn't plan on going. i want to do that. what if one of these days i just didn't go at all&amp;mdash;and never called in sick or late like i so conscientiously do otherwise. it's tempting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;had dylan in the car cd player this morning, and then stuck in my head until i put on some cardigans to clear it out. installing and testing a new version of "express meter" at work all day; somewhat interesting, and so far everything's falling into place quickly and easily&amp;mdash;i've already created the master library, got the latest knowledge base installed, setup the sql server 7 database, and populated the web tables of the db. now i just need to find an asp-enabled web server at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a looong evening... first i had to take trina to pick up her car at the auto glass place in westbrook (this is the third mechanic trip in three weeks for her). then i had to run back to south portland to meet my mom and her crazy cousin beryl for dinner. then i stopped at home for fifteen minutes, then left in a rush to meet lisa in yarmouth (at a gas station, of all the places, since we hadn't yet figured out what restuarants would still be open that late). now, i can finally go to bed, and i have six hours until the alarm rings, so i can take my car into the shop. (hint: don't let your car inspection run seven months over&amp;mdash;the fine is supposedly killer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;called my parents to chat for a little bit. i'm just beginning to realize that they really are fruitcakes, and now it's making sense why we get along so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i hate windows 95, for the record. over the years, i've had frustrations with various software applications and the companies that make them, but never has one matched the contempt i feel for windows 95 every time i have to install it. tonight's aggravation is, specifically, that i'm trying to help my roommate rebuild his pc with 95 for games (98 has been troublesome on his hardware) and 2000 for "serious stuff," but we're not having much success. some computer consultant i am. (oh yeah, i forgot: i'm not a consultant anymore, i'm a "senior software engineer," which apparently means that i drive an antiquated "virtual train.")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my friend dawna is going to nova scotia later on this week, just to scope things out and see if she wants to stay. i'm so jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm going to try to go visit my parents in camden this weekend, somehow. camden is such a pleasant, peaceful place&amp;mdash;just the kind of thing i need right now&amp;mdash;and it's been a while since i've stayed with them up there. somehow i need to figure out how to weasel out of some responsibilities this saturday, though, so i don't have to cut the weekend in half, or drive home and back again for one little thing. (i enjoy driving, and i like my car... but not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; much.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i started into this weekend in dread, fearing all the mess i had made of my schedule and unsure how it was going to work out. never before have i been so glad that nearly everything i planned fell apart, because as it turned out, this weekend was exactly what i needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after church this morning, aaron and dawna and i headed up the hour-and-a-half trek towards boothbay harbor (second day in a row for me and my car) to try to make it for the last event of the jazz festival, a brunch at the fisherman's wharf restuarant with music in the line of cole porter and george gerswinn. well, we missed it... it took us too long to get all the details settled and get out of church, so we arrived at the restuarant right at 2pm. phooey. nonetheless, we had a pleasant little (emphasize that: little) lunch at the ebb tide diner, a walk around the small town, and plenty of time to chat. well worthwhile, i think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dawna and i have been talking recently about making and keeping friendships. i love the way she connects with people almost immediately (this morning exemplified that when i introduced her to my friend lisa, who is deaf, and within minutes dawna and lisa were exchanging email addresses and planning to get together some afternoon). dawna says that much of her ability to connect is intentional, something that she learned over the past few years as she was travelling and uprooting and moving a lot, and realized that she needed to establish connections wherever she went, while at the same time keeping the ties with a few close friends whatever the distance between them. i think i could learn a lot from this&amp;mdash;for me, "out of sight, out of mind" pretty well describes how i treat my friends. i can even lose track of friends that live right here in town, if i don't see them or hear from them regularly, and i don't make the effort to get together with them. tonight i resolved that i need to call several friends that are just in that spot. as the week goes on, i hope i can follow through on this resolution, because i am realizing the importance. i'll keep you posted...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wow, that was just what i needed: "mental health night." excellend music from two different jazz sextets, and a chilly misty fog along the maine coastal villages. i feel so much better, i sang the whole 90-minute drive home. god is good. goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/477084'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/477084'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#477084' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-475860</id><published>2000-07-15T23:34:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-15T23:34:23.280+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a line from the song i'm listening to (the one in the title, on the album-of-the-day) "well i've been trying to negotiate peace with my own existence..." i can understand that. this morning i woke up (eventually) all frustrated with myself and my life and the mess i think i'm making of it&amp;mdash;this is probably an exaggeration, but you know how those sudden depressions can just hit you with a skewed reality, right? well, that was it. anyway, i had originally had so many things going on this weekend, and due to my lack of communication and desire, i've backed out of nearly all of them. i could've been at the asl immersion weekend, but i used work as the excuse not to go. i could've been leading the music for this cruise-and-dinner thing benefitting the crisis pregnancy center i sometimes help out with, but i never called anyone back so i never got signed up. i could've been out on the lake with my group from work, but who wants to spend a saturday with all the people you see monday through friday? and the list of opportunities goes on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thankfully, though, i ended up calling my friend kirsta, who is such an encouragement i don't know how i'd get by without her. she's always willing to patiently listen and talk with me and help straighten out my thinking, especially when i know what i should be doing and i'm just not doing it, like today. so here i am, feeling all sorry for myself and my self-fulfilling prophesies (ask me about troy's opinion on that sometime), and kirsta won't let me do that. after we got off the phone, suddenly i'm all chipper and excited, and i go take care of a couple of the details i had been ignoring all morning, and get settled in my plans for the evening, and most importantly: i'm determined that i'm going to get right with god again now. you see, i've been ignoring him for a while now&amp;mdash;oh sometimes i try to pay attention, or ask a question or two and then never hear a respone, so i get mad and go back to ignoring him&amp;mdash;and you know, life just doesn't work out right when you know the source of life and are staying away from it. (open up the bible and drop your finger on any spot in the old testament&amp;mdash;chances are you landed pretty close to another example of how some person, or the whole nation of israel, has been away from god, and their life is just rotten because of it. and only a few pages later they are restored to him, and all is well... until they forget again. time and again it happened for them, and i can read it, and time and again it happens for me, but it seems i never the learn the lesson.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tonight (actually fairly soon) i'm going alone (a rarity for me) to the boothbay harbor jazz festival, where i think i'll find a nice place to just sit and listen and groove to the music. and hopefully it will be a chance to let my mind think on good things, and find some peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; vigilantes of love &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=374327"&gt;v.o.l.&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; if you like the counting crows, you'll like the vigilantes&amp;mdash;they have similar storytelling lyrics with rich poetic imagery, and that great acoustic-strum sound. a few of these songs will really stick with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a spot of lyrics from the vigilantes' song "skin":&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;now you there with the paintbox&lt;br&gt;
you there with paper and pen&lt;br&gt;
me i got this blunt instrument&lt;br&gt;
i'm gonna play on till the end&lt;br&gt;
and you come with empty hands&lt;br&gt;
or you don't come at all&lt;br&gt;
you deal your best hand out in the marketplace&lt;br&gt;
and let the chips fall&lt;br&gt;
and the package, it comes wrapped up&lt;br&gt;
there is a lesson here&lt;br&gt;
and vincent, he picked up the blade and put it to his ear&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
now look if you're gonna come round here and says those sort of things&lt;br&gt;
you gotta take a few on the chin&lt;br&gt;
talkin bout sin and redemption&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm well over forty hours at work now, on thursday. katrina kicked me under the table when i told her that tonight. for some odd reason she's worried that i'm heading for burnout... i guess she hasn't known me that long. (i burned out a long, long time ago, so now these smouldering coals and ashes can withstand a lot of heat!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;at least today had an enjoyable challenge, so it was fun to work on that all afternoon. bill and i actually started working out the ideas yesterday, but we got right down to making a demo today, because he's going on vacation next week and before that he wants to prove to his boss that it can and will be done. the project is to make a flexible, self-sustaining system which can display all kinds of static and dynamic content on a projection screen they have set up in the factory (the Fab, as it's called in the semiconductor industry). recently, they set up the projector with simple, static PowerPoint slides, but someone got the big idea that we need to have live statistics on production updated 24x7x365. so, we've put together a system involving a single perl cgi and a web page fortified with client-side javascript, which together get a listing of the contents of a specific directory on the web server and roll through the content as a slide show. the scripts accept multiple content formats, including pre-built web pages or acrobat pdf's to more complex pieces such as excel spreadsheets and charts with live database refresh, which need an html wrapper built before the slide show will display them properly. thus, the end result is that the managers who want to put content in that slide show don't need to do anything special with their files to make them work, they just drop the files in the directory and our script does the rest. so, we don't need to do anything to make their data work, and there's no server component which we'd have to fix if it were to fail in the middle of the night. cool, eh? some people pay thousands of dollars for proprietary slideshow and content-generation programs, and we made our own in a couple hours...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of course, there are frustations to my "new" job. one big one is that i often miss out on the big events that i'd planned. for example, earlier this summer i had intended on taking three weeks vacation to go to &lt;a href="http://www.wycliffe.org/quest/"&gt;wycliffe quest&lt;/a&gt; in california, to learn a little more about linguistics and how god might be using me in that field in the future... that vacation got cut down to a one week at home, which my boss and i decided on the friday before the week i took off. the current situation is that i had been planning going to the asl (american sign language) immersion weekend on mackworth island (put on by baxter school for the deaf and &lt;a href="http://www.usm.maine.edu"&gt;usm&lt;/a&gt;), but i had the wrong date in my calendar for the last six months, and it turns out that it's a week earlier than i thought. i can't really get out of work tomorrow, and i have several other things planned this weekend, so i just can't go to the immersion weekend at all (and, the registration fee is mostly non-refundable, argh!). okay, i should stop complaining: i love my job, i love my job, i love my job (don't i sound convincing?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in case you hadn't caught on yet, the title i give each 'blog post are song titles. often the songs are from the album-of-the-day, but not necessarily. sometimes they're just the song that's stuck in my head, sometimes it has a line similar to what i'm writing in my post, and nearly all of the time the song has something to do with what i'm thinking about or going through. just thought i'd let you know. few people can claim to understand me, but at least i'm trying to give you a fighting chance...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/itemid=320930"&gt;suzanne vega&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; (i.e. her self-titled album) suzanne's songwriting is wonderful, even from her very first major-label album. the run-on pair of songs "the queen and soldier" and "knight moves" are both catchy and thoughtful, a dangerous combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'll shut up now; sorry for the run-on. (if you actually read this far, i'd bet you don't mind too much, eh?)&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/468424'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/468424'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#468424' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-463688</id><published>2000-07-13T07:36:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-13T07:36:38.373+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's wednesday night, going into thursday morning now, and i didn't get to go to prison tonight... i couldn't escape from work in time. (in case you didn't know, i visit the state prison in nearby windham every wednesday night&amp;mdash;don't worry, they usually let me out.) also, you know what wednesday night means? i need to at least pretend like i'm going to have the trash and recycling out before the morning pickup. tonight i actually put it out already, and i can hear the sound of the bottle guy rumbling through the glass jars in the blue bins up and down the street. one of these days maybe i'll be nice to him and put in some returnable bottles to reward his efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i need to buy a cheap little web server to put on the line at a friend-of-a-friend's isp, and it needs to run freebsd for security, arguably. (sorry for all the rhyme, you gotta do it some of the time.) i'm thinking i like the little &lt;a href="http://www.compaq.com/products/internetdevices/"&gt;ipaq desktops&lt;/a&gt;. does anyone know how well freebsd will run on those doohickeys? i mean, supposedly v4.0 supports the usb mouse and keyboard as well as the intel pro/100+ management nic, but what about the "multibay" cd-rom or the "intel 3d graphics" card?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;album-of-the-day &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dido's &lt;a href="http://www.cdnow.com/switch/from=sr-8008406/target=buyweb_purchase/DDCN=SD-7822+19025+2"&gt;no angel&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; as mentioned here previously, dido won the spot for the title song on the lousy tv-show "roswell", but don't hold it against her. admittedly, that one hit is the best track on the disc, but the rest of it is still worth a listen if you'd liked the rozy song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i can't decide if i really want to go to bed or not. i'm in the middle of one of those big bouts with insomnia, where i only get about two hours of sleep at some random point in the evening, and get so tired of lying in my bed trying to sqeeze the dizzy thoughts out of my head. (if that last sentence doesn't make sense to you, you probably don't understand chronic insomnia... but then again, if i'm supposed to be such an expert, why haven't i solved the problem yet?) a couple weeks ago i decided to give up talking to all women&amp;mdash;a resolution which i promptly broke, unfortunately&amp;mdash;so now i'm wondering if i need a new goal, one that's within reach. i might just vow never to sleep again&amp;mdash;think of all the benefits!&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/463688'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/463688'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#463688' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-457734</id><published>2000-07-12T04:32:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-12T04:32:34.653+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another looong day at work... and i thought this summer was going to be easy and fun, ha! now that i'm finally home, some mac &amp;amp; cheese for dinner, some bass ale for dessert, a few &lt;a href="http://www.atomfilms.com"&gt;atom films&lt;/a&gt; shorts, and at least an attempt on a good night's sleep should do to fix me up. or maybe i'll spend the whole evening tooling around with web development, or "getting ideas from the internet" (a.k.a.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my first day as a salaried employee, and i put in eleven hours... is this any indication of what i should expect? no doubt. i can just kiss overtime goodbye...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the flip side, i am getting some darn good benefits from the company (national semiconductor) now. as a consultant/contractor for the last few years, i never got any benes like vacation or insurance, so this is a welcome change. now i just have to figure out how to terminate my old health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i went to borders bookstore after work and dinner, and picked up two books:&lt;/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;dorothy l. sayers' &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0939218194/ewallorg"&gt;two plays about god and man&lt;/a&gt;, an out-of-print book from the half-price shelf. i love sayers' books, including the lord peter whimsey mysteries, the theology, and the translations; but i've never read her famous play, "the man who would be king". of course, no one's heard of these plays, hence the 50%-off tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;frommer's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0028635051/ewallorg"&gt;ireland from $60 a day&lt;/a&gt;, which is packed with great tips for inexpensive pleasures and joys of the country (notice i didn't use the term "cheap thrills"). i picked this books over the other ireland tour guides while getting to the bottom of a large mocah au lait, so i'm sure it was a good choice. my old college roommate (tyler) and i have been hoping/planning for a trip to ireland for a while now, so maybe this fall we'll actually go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well, i need some sleep, so maybe tonight i'll hit the sack before midnight. perhaps i'll get a chance to finish one of the books i'm working on right now, so i can start some of the new ones in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/452757'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/452757'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#452757' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-448486</id><published>2000-07-10T12:13:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-10T12:13:22.796+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i can't sleep. my mind and body (they're in cahoots, you know) have been conspiring against me for about as long as i can remember, even when i was a little kid. it's a form of sabotage, really, undermining my credibility with peers and coworkers by rendering me unable to sleep the night before some particularly important or tedious task and therefore causing me to stumble around in a stupor for most of the following day. (for example, i have to get up early for today's orientation classes&amp;mdash;is this early enough?&amp;mdash;and i probably ought to stay awake, at least for the first day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ever watched the wb-network tv show called "roswell"? if you haven't, don't. (in the humble opinion of this narrator, a documentary on hair growth&amp;mdash;which might even include live footage&amp;mdash;would have more of a plot than the "roswell" show has managed so far.) anyway, there's a new pop artist named dido who sings the theme song for that show, which has the line from the chorus: "i won't go, i won't sleep, i can't breathe until you're resting here with me." i guess dido is still agonizing that aeneas left her, so instead of going to sleep in the flames, so to speak, she's just going to smoulder slowly in insomnia. perhaps that story has something to say about my ailment; most likely not. i'm going back to bed for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/448486'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/448486'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#448486' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-447574</id><published>2000-07-10T06:28:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-10T06:28:18.280+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it just started pouring again. i know summer rains are not uncommon up here in new england, but still i think these recent sudden showers have been strange... so much water just falls from the sky in one big "plunk!", then it's all quiet again. or another example: yesterday, when we had sun-showers that left the roads foggy and steaming, as the rain drops evaporated immediately off the hot black pavement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's already stopped raining, or at least puttered down to a drizzle. maybe the sun will come out now, despite the fact that it's only half an hour until midnight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm going to bed... i have new-employee orientation at work early tomorrow morning. (did i mention that i've worked there for three years already, as a consultant?) at least i get to park in the special "orientation-only" parking spots, and i can always hope that they supply the donuts for breakfast...&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/447574'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/447574'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#447574' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-446570</id><published>2000-07-10T01:28:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-10T01:28:34.403+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a question asked of the bride by the boy behind the camera filming the wedding video: "so tell me, honestly now, now that you're married: Is it true the broccoli is the broom of the intestines?" (thanks for that quote, lisa&amp;mdash;i haven't stopped laughing yet.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;just returned from crescent beach out in cape elizabeth. it was originally supposed to be the whole sunday-night bible study (a.k.a. "syzygus," ask me later) crew, but most people ended up finding one reason or another not to go. so it ended up just being dawna, lisa and her daughter zanna, ray and myself... and that was just fine. you know, there's nothing i like more than finding some little spot with some pleasant atmosphere (a coffee shop, a beach, a corner of the hallway) and sitting down with a few friends to chat. you just can't beat that with a wet noodle (well, you could... but it might make a bad impression).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sarah hale and david gibbs (a friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend, actually) put together a book called &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0897322665/ewallorg"&gt;mountain bike! maine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, aptly named because it's part of the "mountain bike! america" series. that was my guidebook (more or less) for this afternoon's excursion. the particular trail i took&amp;mdash;excepting my own detours&amp;mdash;was listed in their book as appropriate for "adventurous beginners." okay, i guess i qualify as that. remind me to actually follow the trail directions closely, instead of playing "choose your own adventure." there are easier ways to kill yourself, i'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/443906'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/440529/posts/default/443906'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ewall.org/blogger/index.html#443906' title=''/><author><name>ewall</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00084500115214924622</uri><email>eric.w.wallace@gmail.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-440529.post-442115</id><published>2000-07-08T19:45:00.000+03:00</published><updated>2000-07-08T19:45:53.763+03:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="3" align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;saturday afternoon, and i'm back at work, but this time i've promised myself it's not for long. i'm taking the new mountain bike out to hollis later today. my roommate (who works in landscaping, and watches the weathermen like horiscopes) says it's going to rain, but i won't allow that. no, none of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i'm really tripping on this liz phair kick. last night i bought the other two albums i didn't have, then i went home and downloaded all the bootlegs i could find.&lt;/p&gt;
