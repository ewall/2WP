2WP - utilities for importing content into WordPress 3.0

I hope to convert some blog-ish content from several sources (including
an old Blogger template and PostNuke CMS) into the latest version of
WordPress (currently, that is v3.0).

This may or may not be of use to someone else, but if it is, enjoy!

- model.py is the WordPress data model for SQLAlchemy/Elixir (unused)

- dominate.py uses minidom to take an ATOM XML input (e.g. Blogger export),
  clean it up, and reverse the order so the result is earliest to latest
